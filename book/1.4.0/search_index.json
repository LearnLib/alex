   \n\n\nAutomata Learning Experience (ALEX) is an extension of LearnLib that allows \nyou run automated tests on web applications and JSON-based REST APIs using active automata learning.\nUsers model basic test inputs for their target application which are used by ALEX to automatically infer an automaton \nmodel, or to be more precise, a Mealy machine that represents the \nbehavior of the web application.\nInstallation and Login\nWe developed and tested ALEX using either Windows 8.1 and higher and Linux Ubuntu 14.10 and higher.\nAs the application runs on JAVA, any other system with an

explanation of the concepts and ways to use ALEX.\nIf you find bugs of any kind relating this application or inaccuracies in this manual, let us know.\nDescription and Features\nALEX offers a simplicity-oriented way to model and execute learning experiments for web applications and web services using active automata learning. \nBased on the function set the LearnLib and inspired by the LearnLib Studio, ALEX lays a focus on the ease to use of the tool while offering an extensive feature set, including:\n\nInferring Mealy machines of web applications and web services using active automata learning techniques\nGraphical symbol and learning process modelling\nAutomatic generation and visualization of\nModels\nAlgorithmic data structures (observation table and discrimination tree)\nStatistics of learning experiments\n\n\nSimultaneous learning of web applications and web services\nVarious learning algorithms and equivalence approximation strategies\nIntegration testing capabilities\nAnd many more...\n\nTerminology\nThis document may contain some terms related to automata learning. \nWe now want to explain often used terms that may be helpful for understanding this document.\n\n    System under learning (SUL)\n    The system we want to infer an automaton model from.\n        Often also called system under testing (SUT.)\n    Symbol\n    We differentiate between input and output symbols.\n        Input symbols are modeled by the user and define possible inputs to a system.\n        Output symbols specify how the system reacts to inputs.\n    Word\n    A sequence of symbols, e.g. *Authenticate, Create Entity, Read Entity, Delete Entity, Logout*.\n    Learner\n    A learner infers an automaton model of an application by posing words to the SUL and analyzing its outputs.\n    Membership Query (MQ)\n    The words the learner poses to the system are called membership queries.\n    Equivalence Query (EQ)\n    An equivalence query is posed by an equivalence oracle. \n        It checks whether the learned automaton represents the behavior of the tested application correctly.\n    Hypothesis\n    A hypothesis is the behavioral automaton model that is learned.\n        The model is called hypothesis due to the black box nature of the SUL. \n        Potentionally, there can always exist a behavior that is not captured by the model.\n    Counterexample\n    A counterexample is a word, where the output of the system and the learned model differ.\n        Counterexamples are used to trigger the refinement of the model.\n        We call a model the *final hypothesis*, if no counterexamples can be found.\n\n\nThe following graphic illustrates the general learning process and thus the relation between the terms listed above.\n\nWorking Objects\n\n    User\n    A user is identified by its email address and can have one of two roles: ADMIN or REGISTERED.\n    Project\n    A project is the main object that the following objects belong to. \n        It is bound to a unique name and a URL that starts with *\"http\\[s\\]://\"* that points to the application to test.\n    Symbol Group\n    Each project has a list of symbol groups. \n        Symbol groups are logical containers for symbols and allow grouping symbols, e.g. by their purpose or by their feature.\n         They are defined by a unique name. \n         For every project, there is a default group with the name \"Default Group\" which can not be deleted.\n    Symbol\n    Symbols are test inputs that are used for learning and testing the target application. \n        Each symbol consists of a sequence of actions that define the actual logic of the symbol once it is executed.\n    Action\n    Actions are atomic operations on an application. \n        In ALEX, there are three types: \n        Web actions are inspired by Selenium and directly interact with the web interface of an application.\n        REST actions define interactions with a REST APIs and General actions allow interoperability between actions and symbols.\n    Learner Configuration\n    For each learning process, a configuration has to be created. \n        It consists of an input alphabet (a set of symbols), a reset symbol (a symbol that is used to reset an application), a learning algorithm, an equivalence approximation strategy and some other parameters.\n    Learner Result\n    The result of a learning process includes the automaton model of the application and some statistics.\n        Inferring the model usually requires multiple iteration. \n        For each iteration step, the intermediate model and the statistics are saved as well.\n    Test Case\n    A test case can be understood as a single integration test. \n        It consists of sequence of symbols that are executed on the system. \n        The execution of a test case either fails or succeeds.\n    Test Suite\n    Multiple test cases can be bundles into a test suite, which can also be nested.\n        If a test suite is executed, all of its containing test cases and test suites are executed as well. \n        The execution succeeds, if all test cases succeeds, otherwhise it fails.\n\n\n\nWorkflow\nRoughly speaking, the functionality of ALEX can be separated in two aspects: testing and learning.\nThe following diagram illustrates the basic workflow.\n\n    \n\n\nAs you can see, the difference between testing and learning is that while tests either pass or fail to execute, a behavioral model is generated while learning.\nIn this user manual, we will go deeper into the single steps listed in the diagram.\nFrontend\nStarting from the entry URL of ALEX, the graphical client can be accessed under http://localhost:;. \nFrom there on, the following URLs lead to

Settings","keywords":"","body":"Application Settings\nThere are some global, application specific settings that only users with admin rights have access to.\nWebDrivers\nFor testing and learning web applications, we use Selenium to interact with web browsers. \nPer default, only the headless WebDriver HTMLUnit and Safari are supported since they do not require a user to download executables that enable Selenium to communicate with them.\nNote that Safari is only supported if ALEX is running on a MacOS system. \nOtherwise, the option is still displayed, but will not work for testing or learning.\n\nFor other web browsers, namely Chrome, Firefox and Edge, driver executables have to be downloaded.\nWe provide links to the download pages, but you have to make sure that the version of the executable supports the version of the web browser you have installed.\nAfter you have downloaded an executable, enter the absolute path to the file in the corresponding input field, as depicted in 1.\nIn Linux systems, there might be an error that saying that the driver executable is not executable.\nThen, change the permissions of the file e.g. like chmod +x chromedriver.\nYou can also define a browser which is used for testing and learning per default.\nTherefore, a dropdown menu on the bottom of the page 2 lets you select a web browser.\nDon't forget to save the changes you have made 3.\nFurther, using the Edge browser on Linux and MacOS is not supported, and also Safari is not supported on Linux and Windows systems.\nThe option is still visible, but using a web browser on an operating system that does not support it will result in errors.\n"},"contents/user-manual/project-management.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/project-management.html","title":"Project Management","keywords":"","body":"Project Management\nProjects are the entities that are used to manage multiple target applications in ALEX. \nYou can, for example, create a project for your application in version x and another one for version x+1 while having a different sets of input symbols.\nA project is bound to the user that created it and can not be shared between other users.\nAfter the login, you will see an overview of all created projects like depicted below.\n\nCreating, Editing and Deleting Projects\nIn order to create a new project, fill out the form on the left. \nA new project has the following properties:\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nName\nA unique name for your project\nyes\n\n\nURL\nThe root URL your application is accessible under\nyes\n\n\nDescription\nA description of your project\nno\n\n\nMirror URLs\nAlternative URLs where the target is accessible under\nno\n\n\n\nThe URL of a new project has to start with http:// or https:// followed by at least one further character for the host. \nThe URL can, but does not have to end with a trailing '/'. \nTechnically, any host can be entered and therefore any web site can be learned. \nDue to the traffic that is caused by the learning process, it is recommended to only learn web applications you are the owner of, be it a local or a remote host.\nEspecially for performance reasons, a local installation of the target application is recommended.\nIn the text area with the label Mirror URLs multiple more URLs where the application or replications of it are accessible can be specified, one per line.\nThis is useful for parallelizing aspects of the learning process, thus, making it faster.\nIt is important that these replications do not share the same state.\nIf you want to edit or delete a project, click on 1 and the following modal window will pop up where the same form as for the creation is displayed.\n\nDeleting and updating projects can be done under the premise that there is no active learning process with the project.\nBefore deleting a project, make sure you have exported your symbols, hypotheses and/or statistics because with the deletion of a project, all these entities are deleted from the database, too.\nWorking with a Project\nMost aspects of ALEX require that a project is opened, which means that is has been selected from the project list. \nIt is then saved in the session storage of the web browser, so that, in case of a page refresh, the project does not have to be opened again. \nYou can select a project you want to work with it by clicking on 2 which will redirect you to the dashboard of the project (see picture below).\n\nThe dashboard displays some information about the project itself, an indicator for the state of a running learning process and a quick link to the latest learning result.\nIn order to switch to another project you have to close the current one first. \nThe button for this action can be found in the menu under the navigation point with the name of the opened project 3. \nIt redirects back to the project overview. \nSince the current project is persisted per tab, working on multiple projects simultaneously is possible by loading ALEX in another browser tab.\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/","title":"Symbol Modelling","keywords":"","body":"Symbol Management\nThe modelling of input symbols is a key aspect of using ALEX.\nThey define interactions with the system under learning and thus are the building blocks of every learning process and test case.\n\nOnce you have logged in and opened a project, click on 1 to open the view for the symbol management.\nSymbol Groups\nSymbol groups are logical container for symbols.\nPer default, there is a default group that is created during the creation of the project.\nThe default group can not be deleted, and all symbols, if not specified otherwise, are put into it.\nYou can create a new group by clicking on 2 and select the corresponding item from the dropdown menu.\nYou are then asked for a name for the group, which has to be unique.\nOnce a group has been created, you can edit and delete it, by clicking on the gear icon that is found on the right.\nSymbols\nWhen creating a new symbol (see 2), you have to specify two properties:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nA unique name of the symbol\n\n\nsymbol group\nThe group in which the symbol is put. Per default, the default group of the project is used.\n\n\n\nOnce the symbol has been created successfully, it appears in the specified group.\nFor each symbol, there is a list of operations that are accessible by clicking on the menu 3 of which most are self explanatory.\nIn the menu on top of the page, these operations are available for a batch of symbols.\nEach symbol contains of a sequence of actions, that are managed in a separate view.\nClick on the link below the symbol name or the item Actions in menu 3 to open the action management for the symbol, which is covered in this section.\nRestoring Deleted Symbols\nOnce you delete a symbol, it is not really removed from the database.\nInstead, they are put into the symbol trash bin, which works similar to its equivalent from various operating systems.\nThe only difference is that symbols cannot be deleted permanently, because they still might be referenced by e.g. learner results or test cases you have modeled.\n\nYou can see all deleted symbols in the trash bin overview which can be accessed via the item Trash in the sidebar.\nThe only operation you can do here is to recover deleted symbols.\nA recovered symbol is then moved into the default group.\nExport & Import\nIf you want to save a set of symbols for another project or use existing ones, ALEX offers an export and import feature.\nNote that existing symbol groups are not exported in order to be compatible with other projects.\n\nIn order to export symbols, select the corresponding symbols in the overview and click on the export button 1.\nYou are then asked for name of the JSON file which will be downloaded.\n\nIn the same view, you can import existing symbols from a JSON file by clicking on 2 which opens a modal window.\n\nHere, drag and drop the JSON file into the field 3 and the symbols will be displayed below.\nThe import will not work unless the names of the symbols are unique within the project.\nSo, edit the symbol names 4 or delete the ones you do not need.\nFinally, confirm your selection by clicking on 5.\nIf everything goes fine, the modal window will close automatically and the symbols appear in the default group.\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/actions.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nThe function of a symbol is defined by its actions and their execution order. \nAn action can be understood as an atomic interaction with a system, like clicking on a button, submitting a form, making an HTTP request to a REST API and so on.\n\nIn the actions view of a symbol, the sequence of actions, which can be rearranged via drag and drop, is displayed.\nEverything you do here is not saved automatically.\nInstead, a notification on the top 3 notifies you that something has changed.\nA click on the Save button saves the action and you are safe to navigate to another page.\n\nA click on the create button opens a modal window, where, on the left, the list of all possible actions is listed.\nOn the right, the form for a selected action is displayed. \nWith 4 you can search for an action by its name instead of searching it in the list.\nEach action can be marked with three different flags which are\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnegated\nNegates the outcome of an action.\n\n\nignoreFailure\nIf this flag is set to \"true\" proceeding actions are executed although the action failed.\n\n\ndisabled\nIf this flag is set to \"true\" its execution is skipped during the call of its symbol. 2\n\n\n\nNormally, the output of a system is either \"Ok\" or \"Failed\" depending on success of the execution of the symbol.\nIf this is not expressive enough, you can also specify a custom failure output of each action that is propagated to the symbol.\nInsert the custom output in 6 (image above).\nIn this field, dynamic values can be inserted as well (see section about variables and counters below).\nIn the overview, you see another input field for the custom success output of the symbol.\nThe value that is inserted here will be the output in case all actions can be executed successfully.\nNote that there can be dynamic outputs as well via variables and counters (see below).\n\nA useful feature is that you can also use copy, cut and paste operations on actions, if e.g. symbols behave similar.\nThe option for this can be found in the dropdown menu on the right of each action or for a batch operation on selection actions in the action bar on top 7.\nIn the next sections, we go a little deeper into the single categories of actions.\nWeb Actions\nWeb actions are used to interact with a browser interface like a normal user would. \nThey are based on Selenium and ALEX offers a subset of the Selenium functionality that are presented in the table below.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAlert - Accept/Dismiss\nAccepts or dismisses an alert dialog.\n\n\nAlert - Get Text\nSave the displayed text of an alert/confirm/prompt window in a variable.\n\n\nAlert - Send keys\nSend user input to a prompt alert.\n\n\nCheck Attribute\nChecks the value of an attribute of an element\n\n\nCheck Node\nCheck if a certain element is present on the website.\n\n\nCheck Text\nCheck if a certain text is part of the website body.\n\n\nCheck Title\nChecks if the page title is a certain string.\n\n\nClear\nClear an input field.\n\n\nClick\nClick or double click on an element.\n\n\nClick Link By Text\nClick on a link with a specific text value.\n\n\nExecute JavaScript\nExecute a JavaScript snipped in the page.\n\n\nFill\nClear and fill an input field with some text.\n\n\nOpen URL\nRequest a specific site.\n\n\nMove Mouse\nMove the cursor to a specific element or coordinates\n\n\nPress Key\nPress a special key on the keyboard\n\n\nSubmit\nSubmit a form.\n\n\nSelect\nSelect an option form an select input field.\n\n\nSwitch to\nSwitch back to the parent content or the default content from another frame.\n\n\nSwitch to Frame\nSwitch the Selenium context to another frame.\n\n\nWait for Attribute\nWait until an attribute of an element has or contains a specific value.\n\n\nWait for Text\nWait until a specific text is visible on the website.\n\n\nWait for Title\nWait until the title of a page changes.\n\n\nWait for Node\nWait until the state of an element changes.\n\n\n\nMore detailed information about the parameters of each web action is omitted here, since the forms in the frontend should be labeled sufficiently.\nIf you play around a little with the action editor, you may realize that most web actions require you to enter a CSS or an XPath expression to an element. \nThis may be not that easy to find out in case you are not very familiar with HTML, CSS or XPath. \nSo, there is a button that is labeled with \"Element Picker\". \nThis is a special feature of ALEX for extracting selectors elements from your website directly without having to know HTML.\nVisit this section to see how the use the element picker.\nREST Actions\nREST actions are the counterpart to web actions. They are used to communicate with REST APIs. \nThe table below shows a list of available actions.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCheck Attribute\nCheck if the response has an specific attribute.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Type\nCheck if an attribute in the response has a specific type.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Value\nCheck if an attribute in the response has a specific value.\n\n\nCheck Header Field\nCheck if the response has a certain header field.\n\n\nCheck Status\nCheck if a previous response returned the expected HTTP status.\n\n\nMake Request\nMakes an HTTP request\n\n\nSearch in Body\nSearch for a piece of text in the HTTP response body.\n\n\nValidate JSON\nValidate the body of a response against a JSON schema.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that working with HTTP requests and responses follows a certain pattern. \nNormally, you make a request and analyze the results. \nThe order of your REST actions should also look like that. \nStart with a Make Request action and use other actions to work with the response.\nThe context of the Make Request action, namely the HTTP response, is passed to the following actions until the next Make Request action is made.\nGeneral Actions\nActions of this group allow the interaction between different symbols and actions, for example by storing and passing String and Integer values to other actions.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAssert Counter\nAsserts the value of a counter.\n\n\nAssert Variable\nAsserts the value of a variable.\n\n\nIncrement Counter\nIncrement a counter by a given value.\n\n\nSet Counter\nSet a counter to a new value.\n\n\nSet Variable\nSet a variable to a new value.\n\n\nSet Variable by Cookie\nSet a variable to the value of a cookie\n\n\nSet Variable by HTML Element\nSet a variable to a value form a website element.\n\n\nSet Variable by JSON Attribute\nSet a variable to a value form a JSON response.\n\n\nSet Variable by Node Attribute\nSet a variable to the value of an attribute of an element.\n\n\nSet Variable by Node Count\nSet a variable to the number of elements matching a selector.\n\n\nSet Variable by Regex Group\nSet a variable to a group in a regex match.\n\n\nWait\nWait for a specific amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n    The wait action can be useful for background tasks or AJAX calls, but should be used with caution because it can slow down the learn process.\n\n\n\nVariables, Counters and Files\nMany web applications handle dynamic data and allow file uploads. \nIn order to model and learn such behaviors and to pass data between symbols, actions and learn processes, variables, counters and files can be used.\n\n    Variables\n    \n        Variables contain (also empty) String values and are kept alive for a single membership query.\n    \n    Counters\n    \n        Counters are positive integer values that are persisted in the database per project. \n        They can be incremented and modified at will using corresponding actions. \n        Usually, they are used to create multiple objects of the same kind, e.g. user1, user2, ... and so on. \n        Further, counters can help to model a system reset and thereby allow a consecutive execution of multiple learn processes without having to manually reset the application in between every test.\n    \n    Files\n    \n        In order to learn websites that allow its users to upload files, this feature can be used as well.\n        See this page for a more detailed description and their usage.\n    \n\n\nIn order to make use of those in actions, there is a small template language that has to be used in action fields:\n\n\n\nNotation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n{{#counterName}}\nThe value of the counter with the name counterName is inserted\n\n\n{{$variableName}}\nThe value of the variable with the name variableName is inserted\n\n\n{{\\filename.ext}}\nThe absolute path of the file filename.ext is inserted\n\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates the usage of variables.\nThe process can be transferred easily for counters and files.\n\nAssume we have an application that manages todo items and the element with the selector #new-todo is the input field that allows a user to create a new item.\nWe now want to insert the content of the item dynamically via a variable.\nFirst, create an action that sets the value of the variable.\nAs you can see in the picture above, there are some choices for how to do this.\n\nThen, we create another action that inserts the value of the variable into the element #new-todo.\nIn the input field for the value, we use the notation from the table above to indicate that we want to insert the value of the variable todoName.\nAs soon as the action is executed, the value of todoName is inserted automatically. \nIn the todo list, a todo with the text \"buy milk\" would appear in the application.\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/element-picker.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/element-picker.html","title":"Element Picker","keywords":"","body":"Element Picker\nFor modeling actions that interact with the web browser, we need to specify the unique selector to the element we want to interact with.\nA HTML document usually looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Link A\n    Link B\n  \n\n\n\nFor example, the first link has an ID, so the selector would simply be #link.\nThe second link does not have an ID, so the selector corresponds to the path from the body (or a parent element with an ID) to that element.\nHere, the selector for the second link would be body > div:nth-child(1) > a:nth-child(2) which reads as the second direct child \"a\" node in the first direct child \"div\" node of the body.\nAs you can imagine, websites are not necessarily structured that simple, and elements are nested deeply.\nThe deeper an element that has no ID is in the tree, the longer and therefore more complex the selector to that element might be.\nWriting these selectors by hand is error prone and unnecessary hard.\nBecause of this, we offer a feature we call Element Picker which extracts the selector of an element automatically.\n\nTo use the element picker while creating an action, click on the corresponding button 1.\n\nThe element picker pops up and loads the web application that you specified in the project into an iframe.\nPer default, you will get a message in the header that you see in the image above.\nNormally, web browsers deny access to the structure of the website inside of an iframe due to security reasons.\nIn order to use the element picker as intended, follow the following instructions and restart the web browser:\n\n\n\nBrowser\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nFirefox\nInstall a plugin like CORS Everywhere\n\n\nChrome\nStart chrome with disabled web security parameters: --disable-web-security --user-data-dir or install a similar plugin\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the element picker will look like above.\nStart the selection by clicking on the button with the toggle icon 2.\nThe button on the right lets you switch between the CSS selector and an equivalent XPath expression.\n\nSelect an element by moving your mouse over the target element, which is highlighted with a big, red border 3.\nIn the header, the selector to the element is displayed.\nIf you are satisfied with the selection, just click on the element.\n\nFinally, accept your selection by clicking on 4 or start over.\n\nThe selector, and in some cases other data is automatically inserted into the corresponding input field 5 of the action.\nSelecting Elements in the Browser\nIf you encounter issues with the element picker, you can also use your favourite web browser to get the selectors of elements.\nHere, the usage of Chrome for this is demonstrated, but the procedure can be transferred to other web browsers as well.\n\nFirst, right click on the target element and click on \"Inspect\" 1.\n\nThis will open the developer tools of the web browser which displays the structure of the website and highlights the corresponding element in blue.\nPerform a right click on the highlighted element and navigate to \"Copy > Copy selector\" 2 or \"Copy XPath\".\nThe unique selector to the element is copied into the clipboard and can be pasted into the input field in ALEX.\n\n    In Firefox, the extracted selector might not be unique, so use them with

Setup\nIn order to start learning an application, a learn process has to be modeled. \nSuch a process always consists of the following components:\n\nAn input alphabet (set of symbols)\nA symbol to reset the application (see this section)\nA learning algorithm\nA parametrized equivalence oracle\nA maximum amount of steps to learn\nA specification of a web browser\n\n\nIn the setup view, the list of symbols is displayed from which you have to select the symbols that should be used for the input alphabet.\nFurthermore, a special symbol that resets the application has to be selected.\nMark the corresponding symbol by clicking on the button 1.\nOnce selected, the reset symbol can not be included in the input alphabet.\nConfiguration\nThe next step is the configuration of the learning process.\nA click on the button with the gear icon at 2 opens the modal window that is displayed below.\n\nHere, in the tab \"Learner\" (left), select a learning algorithm first.\nPer default, the TTT algorithm is preselected because it usually performs better than the other available options.\nThen, configure the equivalence approximation strategy:\n\n    Random Word\n    \n        The Random Word EQ oracle approximates an equivalence query by generating random words from the input alphabet and executes them on the system. \n        The oracles expects three parameters: minLength (> 0) defines the minimum length of a generated word, maxLength (>= minLength) the maximum length and numberOfWords (> 0) the amount of randomly generated words to test.\n    \n    Complete\n    \n        The Complete EQ oracle generates all possible words from an alphabet within some limits. \n        minDepth (> 0) describes the minimum length of word, maxDepth (>= minDepth) the maximum length.\n    \n    W-Method\n        \n            The W-Method EQ oracle generates words based on a transition coverage of the graph under the assumption of maxDepth additional states.\n        \n    Sample\n    \n        If this oracle is chosen, counterexamples are searched and specified manually by the user.\n    \n    Hypothesis\n    \n        Uses an ideal model of an application to search for differences and uses them as counterexamples.\n        Note that the input alphabets should be the same.\n    \n\n\nThe input field for the maximum amount of steps to learn indicates how many intermediate hypotheses the learner has to generate before the learning process is stopped.\nThe value -1 means that the learner stops if no more counterexample is found.\nAnother value, for example 3, would stop the learner after having generated three hypotheses, although this might not be the final one.\nOf cause, if the final hypothesis is learned before those three steps, the learner stops beforehand.\nThis way, it is possible to e.g. learn the first three steps with a randomized equivalence oracle and then continue learning with another one.\nIn the WebDriver tab (right) you can configure which web browser is used for accessing the target web application during the learning process.\nEach web driver has individual options which are displayed once you select a web browser from the select input.\n\n    Xvfb is used for Linux enviroments where no phyiscal screen is present.\n    Thus, this option can not be used if ALEX runs on a Windows machine.\n\n\nSave the configuration with a click on the Save button.\nFinally, click on the Start learning button in the button group 2 to start the learning process.\n"},"contents/user-manual/learning/learning.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/learning/learning.html","title":"Learning","keywords":"","body":"Learning\n\nAfter having started a learning process and while the learner is active, ALEX shows you a loading screen where you find different information about the current process.\nIn the top half, several statistics and the membership queries that are being executed at the moment are displayed.\nBelow, the current state of the model is displayed. \nYou can navigate through all intermediate models 1 or view details about the current step, change the layout of the model and export the model in the menu 2.\nHypotheses are represented as Mealy machines and represent the learned behavior of the target application. \nNodes are labeled from 0 to n, where nodes represent the internal states of the target application and state 0 (visualised by a green node) is the initial state. \nEdges denote transitions from one state to another where the edge labels show the symbols whose execution led to the transition into another state.\nEdge labels have the following pattern:\n\n / Ok\n / Failed ()\n / \n\nwhere  is the name of the symbol and the text after the \"/\" displays the output of the system.\nIn ALEX, the output of the system is interpreted as \"Ok\", if all actions of a symbol have been executed successfully.\nOn the other hand \"Failed (n)\" means that the execution failed on the n-th action of the symbol.\nAs you may remember, in this section we introduced the possibility to define custom outputs.\nCustom success or error outputs for a symbol have a higher priority over the default ones. \n\nAfter some time, when no more counterexamples can be found, the learner finishes and the final hypothesis is presented like above.\nFrom here on, you can, if you find it necessary, configure how the learning process should be continued.\nYou can also select the equivalence oracle Sample and search for counterexamples by yourself, which is explained in the following.\nFinding Counterexamples Manually\nBeside automated strategies for finding counterexamples, there is the option to search for counterexamples by hand directly on a model.\n\nTherefore, select the equivalence oracle Sample from the select input in the sidebar.\nThen, click together a word by clicking on the edge labels of the hypothesis.\nAfter that, click on 1 to check if the word actually is a counterexample.\n\nIf this is the case, a notification will pop up and the actual system output of the word will be displayed at 3.\nFinally, click on the Resume button to initiate the refinement of the model given your counterexample.\nResuming a Previous Learning Process\nThe learning process usually takes a lot of time when learning models from web applications.\nThe more annoying it is if the learning process is interrupted due to various reasons and you have to start learning from the beginning.\nLuckily, there is the possibility to resume an old process from an intermediate model.\n\nIn the results overview, expand the dropdown menu on the corresponding result and click on the item labeled by Continue learning 1.\n\nYou are being redirected to the view you should be familiar with from the learning process.\nHere, simply select the step 2 you want to continue learning from and configure the equivalence oracle according to your needs.\nFinally, click on 3 to resume the learning process.\n\n    When resuming a learning process and using the random equivalence oracle, make sure you use a different seed that in the run before.\n    Otherwhise, membership queries are posed that have been posed before, which is not effective.\n\n\n\nYou can even add additional input symbols that should be included in the next iteration of the learning process by selecting them in 4.\nRestrictions While Learning\nWhile ALEX is learning there are some restrictions concerning the functionality:\n\nYou can not delete the current project as the instance is required by the learner. \nDue to the architecture of ALEX, there can always only be one learning process at a time per

did not find as many counterexamples as the other.\nThe system under learning has changed, be it because a regression between the two test runs.\nIn this case, the separating word gives you an entry point for debugging the application or it represents the change correctly.\n\nThen, you can calculate the difference between two models.\nIn contrast to the separating word, all words are calculated where both models differ.\nThe result is displayed as a tree, where the paths with same suffixes have been merged for a better overview, like depicted in the picture below, where the difference is

These rely on our own experiences while modelling and learning several web applications.\nSymbol Modelling\nWhen modelling symbols, the granularity of modelling your application matters and it is advised that you think in use cases. Here is the reason why:\nFor example, if you create an input symbol for each possible click on each link or button, you might have a very detailed and concrete model of your applications behavior, but it will not be visually observable. \nAdditionally, learning will usually take much longer as the number of symbols grows.\nIn contrast to that, you should not treat a symbol as a whole integration test. \nFor example you could create a symbol TestAuthenticationSystem that creates a user, logs him in and then out. \nThis has several disadvantages. \nYou do not test at any other point of your application if a logout is possible without explicitly modelling it twice. \nFurthermore, the learned model will most likely not represent your real system very accurately.  \nInstead, we think it is good if you create something in between those extremes. \nAs already mentioned, try modelling use cases of your application. \nAs an example, have a look at Wordpress. \nPossible symbols could be:\n\nLogin\nLogout\nCreate a post\nPublish a post\nMark a comment as spam\n...\n\nEach point can be modelled as a symbol and the learned model will tell you clearly what is possible and what is not while still be able to easily find possible errors in an application.\nModelling Authentication Systems\nBasic HTTP Authentication\n\nThe Call action and the Open URL action both support the specification of credentials, consisting of a login and a password, in order to use basic HTTP auth.\nJSON Web Tokens\n\nJWTs are usually used to authenticate against REST APIs by sending an encoded token in the Authorization header, like Authorization: Bearer . \nIn ALEX, you can specify HTTP headers in the Call action.\nIt usually makes sense to store the JWT in a variable and let ALEX insert it dynamically, like in the image above.\nCookie-based Authentication\nIn the Call action you can specify both, cookies and additional HTTP header fields, if necessary.\nResetting an Application\nWhile learning, sequences of symbols are created and executed on your application. \nWe assume that your application behaves deterministically, i.e. each sequence that is executed will always, at any time in the system yield the same output. \nAs a consequence, for each sequence, the system has to be put in a state where all further executions are independent from the ones before.\nFor this reason it is required that you model a system reset with a separate symbol.\nWhat a reset looks like is up to you and depends on your application, but here are some examples that might be relevant for your application:\nIf you have a static web site that only consists of a few linked html files and you want to make sure they are linked correctly, the reset symbol could consist of an action to go to the front page.\nIf you have a user management system and want to test user specific features only, your reset symbol could simply consist of the creation of a new user. \nFor example if you want to test a users ability to create, update and delete a business entity, then, a reset could create a new user and log him in. \nIf he now creates a entity, his action does not interfere with actions executed by previous users.\nSometimes it may be necessary to clear the database in order to remove all entities. \nSince we have no actions that connects to your database to execute queries you will have to work around that, e.g. by \n\ncreating a temporary REST endpoint that is called that resets the database, or by \nadding a button to the frontend that is hidden in the admin panel that does the same.\n\nAs you can see, how you model a system reset is not always trivial and is highly dependant on how your application works and what exactly you want to test.\nLearning Process Configuration\nBefore you start a learning process, you can configure some parameters like the algorithm used or the equivalence oracle. \nALEX runs all tests with reasonable preconfigured settings.\nHere are some advices:\n\nThe TTT algorithm usually performs best.\nThe default settings for the Random Word equivalence oracle is ok for models that you do not expect to get bigger than 4 to 6 states. \nThere is no real rule of thumb here, but if you expect your models to be bigger that that, adjust the parameters correspondingly.\nThe complete and W-method equivalence oracle can be used when you can run your tests over night or the weekend, or for a really small alphabet size. \nEnabling the membership query cache is preferred.\nProvide multiple mirror URLs during the project creation so that equivalence oracles and some algorithms can perform better.\n\nLearning JavaScript Enabled Applications\n\nWhen modelling symbols for JavaScript heavy websites, e.g. single page applications, make use of the wait for ... actions when interacting with elements of the website. \nThis way, Selenium can handle dynamic changes of the DOM better.\n\nFurther Remarks\n\n\nSometimes, you might get a cryptic error message while learning (like in the image above) that says something like: expected symbol ok ok failed(1) but got symbol ok failed(2) ok.\nThis means that the same query resulted in two different system outputs, which indicates that the system does not behave deterministically.\nMore often, the real reason is one of the following:\n\nFaulty symbol modelling, triggered by a counter that has not been incremented or something like that.\nSelenium behaves off which mostly happens in single page applications.\nRefactor the modelling of the symbol that leads to the error, e.g. add more timeouts.\nThe driver executable fails to connect to the web browser, which can happen at times.\nThe only solution here is to continue learning from the last known hypothesis.\n\n\n\n"},"contents/cli/":{"url":"contents/cli/","title":"CLI","keywords":"","body":"ALEX CLI\nALEX offers a command line interface (cli) for executing tests and starting learning

following commands:\ncd cli/src/main/javascript\nnpm install\n\nFurthermore, make sure that the backend of ALEX is running.\nLook at the start page of this documentation to get instructions for how to run ALEX.\nExecuting Integration Tests\nFor executing tests from the cli, you need three files:\n\nA JSON file with exported symbols\nA JSON file with exported test cases\nA JSON file that contains the configuration for the web driver\n\nYou can obtain (1) and (2) by exporting the symbols and test cases in the frontend of ALEX.\nThe file for (3) may look like this:\n// config.testing.json\n{\n

If set to 0, the default width is used.\n\n\nheadless\nIf the browser should run in headless mode. Make sure the browser supports that. It is ignored otherwise.\n\n\n\nThe cli itself can be found at cli/src/main/javascript.\nHere, execute node alex-cli.js -h to get a list of all parameters.\nAn exemplary call for executing tests would be:\nnode alex-cli.js --uri \"http://localhost:8000\" \\\n                 --target \"https://www.google.com\" \\\n                 -a \"test\" \\\n                 -u \"admin@alex.example:admin\" \\\n                 -s \"/home/alex/google.symbols.json\" \\\n                 -t \"/home/alex/google.tests.json\" \\\n                 -c \"/home/alex/config.test.json\"\n\nFinally, the project that has been created automatically during the testing, is deleted.\nStarting Learning Experiments\nYou can also run learning experiments with the cli.\nThe only difference is that the configuration file is a little more complex.\nAn example configuration file would look like this:\n// config.learning.json\n{\n    \"algorithm\": {\n        \"name\": \"TTT\"\n    },\n    \"browser\": {\n        \"driver\": \"chrome\",\n        \"width\": 1280,\n        \"height\": 720,\n        \"headless\": true\n    },\n    \"comment\" : \"\",\n    \"eqOracle\": {\n        \"type\": \"random_word\",\n        \"minLength\": 1,\n        \"maxLength\": 1,\n        \"maxNoOfTests\": 1,\n        \"seed\": 42\n    },\n    \"maxAmountOfStepsToLearn\" : -1,\n    \"resetSymbol\": \"Reset\",\n    \"symbols\": [\"Search Term\", \"Website in Results?\", \"Next Page\"],\n    \"useMQCache\": true\n}\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nalgorithm\nThe algorithm to use.

What can I do?  \nInitially, we did not develop ALEX as a solution to all situations that may occur in a web application, but to the most common ones.\nIf you think a key feature is missing, feel free to submit an issue or create a pull request on GitHub and we will see what we can do. \n"}}}
