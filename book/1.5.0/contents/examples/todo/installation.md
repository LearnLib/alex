# Installation

## Setup ToDo

In order to setup ToDo, download the archive from [here](../../../assets/files/ToDo.zip) and extract it to an arbitrary location. 
Make sure you have Java JRE or JDK v8 or higher installed. 
Open a terminal, navigate to where the extracted files are located and execute `java -jar ./jetty-runner.jar --port 9090 ./Todo-App.war`. 
Then, open `http://localhost:9090` in a web browser of your choice. 
You should see the login form of ToDo which looks like this:

You can login with the default admin account: _admin@admin.de_ as email and _admin_ as password. 
Maybe, login once and play around a little to get a feel of the application before learning it.
