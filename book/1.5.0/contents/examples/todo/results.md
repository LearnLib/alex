In this case, click on the __Statistics__ item from the sidebar. 
The view opens that lists all learned processes. 
Click on the result you want to view statistics from and some plots are generated.

    In the current version of ALEX, the menu item does not exist.
    To get statisitics, go to "Learning > Results" instead.
    There are buttons in the action bar for generating charts.
