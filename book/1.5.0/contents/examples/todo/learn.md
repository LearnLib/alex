After the symbols have been modeled, you can start learning ToDo. 
Navigate to the setup view by clicking on the item __Setup__ in the sidebar.

The view looks similar to the one for managing symbols. 
Now, select the symbols that should be learned, but exclude the reset symbol.

Before we learn ToDo, we want to configure some parameters for the learning process. 
By clicking on the gear icon on the top right, we open a new modal window that reveals options to configure the process.

Here, we only adjust the equivalence oracle as seen in the image. 
Save the changes by clicking on the __Save__ button.
