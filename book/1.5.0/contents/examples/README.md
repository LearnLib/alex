# Examples

In order to get to know ALEX and active automata learning in general, this section provides some examples to try for yourself.
The first part covers a step-by-step instruction on how to learn an exemplary *todo* application with ALEX.
In the second part, all necessary information is given for learning the *[TodoMVC][todomvc]* collection. 
Then, there is also an example for learning the REST API of [Wordpress][wordpress] which, however, may not be up to date.
