explanation of the concepts and ways to use ALEX.\nIf you find bugs of any kind relating this application or inaccuracies in this manual, let us know.\nDescription and features\nALEX offers a simplicity-oriented way to model and execute learning experiments for web applications and web services using active automata learning. \nWith version 1.5.0 ALEX has been extended to support conventional testing, too.\nBased on features of LearnLib and inspired by the LearnLib Studio, ALEX lays a focus on the ease to use of the tool while offering an extensive feature set, including:\n\nInferring Mealy machines of web applications and web services using active automata learning techniques\nGraphical symbol and learning process modelling\nAutomatic generation and visualization of\nModels\nAlgorithmic data structures (observation table and discrimination tree)\nStatistics of learning experiments\n\n\nSimultaneous learning of web applications and web services\nVarious learning algorithms and equivalence approximation strategies\nGUI testing capabilities\nAnd much more...\n\nRequired skills\nAs a user of ALEX and tester of web applications, you should\n\nbe familiar with HTML and CSS\nbe familiar with REST interfaces and exchange formats like JSON\nhave logical thinking abilities\nhave a basic understanding of active automata learning\nhave a basic understanding of web application testing\n\nIt helps if you are familiar with programming in general and have already used Selenium.\nTerminology\nThis document contains some terms related to automata learning which are listed in the following:\n\n    System under learning (SUL)\n    The system we want to infer an automaton model from.\n        Often also called system under testing (SUT).\n    Symbol\n    We differentiate between input and output symbols.\n        Input symbols are modeled by the user and define possible inputs to a system.\n        Output symbols specify how the system reacts to inputs.\n    Word\n    A sequence of symbols, e.g. *Authenticate, Create Entity, Read Entity, Delete Entity, Logout*.\n    Learner\n    A learner infers an automaton model of an application by posing words to the SUL and analyzing its outputs.\n    Membership Query (MQ)\n    The words the learner poses to the system are called membership queries.\n    Equivalence Query (EQ)\n    An equivalence query is posed by an equivalence oracle. \n        It checks whether the learned automaton represents the behavior of the tested application correctly.\n    Hypothesis\n    A hypothesis is the behavioral automaton model that is learned.\n        The model is called hypothesis due to the black box nature of the SUL. \n        Theoretically, there can always exist a behavior that is not captured by the model.\n    Counterexample\n    A counterexample is a word, where the output of the system and the learned model differ.\n        Counterexamples are used to trigger the refinement of the model.\n        We call a model the final hypothesis, if no counterexamples can be found.\n\n\nThe following graphic illustrates the general learning process and thus the relation between the terms listed above.\n\nBusiness entities in ALEX\n\n    User\n    A user is identified by its email address and can have one of two roles: ADMIN or REGISTERED.\n    Project\n    A project is the main entity that the following entities belong to. \n        It is bound to a unique name and a URL that starts with *\"http\\[s\\]://\"* that points to the application to test.\n    Symbol group\n    Each project has a list of symbol groups. \n        Symbol groups are logical containers for symbols and allow grouping symbols, e.g. by their purpose or by their feature.\n         They are defined by a unique name. \n         For every project, there is a default group with the name \"Default Group\" which can not be deleted.\n    Symbol\n    Symbols are test inputs that are used for learning and testing the target application. \n        Each symbol consists of a sequence of actions that define the actual logic of the symbol once it is executed.\n    Action\n    Actions are atomic operations on the application. \n        In ALEX, there are three types: \n        Web actions are inspired by Selenium and directly interact with the web interface of an application.\n        REST actions define interactions with a REST APIs.\n        Finally, general actions allow interoperability between actions and symbols.\n    Learner configuration\n    A learning process is a combination of several parameters: \n        It consists of an input alphabet (a set of symbols), a reset symbol (a symbol that is used to reset an application), a learning algorithm, an equivalence approximation strategy and some other parameters.\n    Learner result\n    The result of a learning process includes the automaton model of the application and some statistics.\n        Inferring the model usually requires multiple iterations. \n        For each iteration step, the intermediate model and the statistics are saved as well.\n    Test case\n    A test case can be understood as a single integration test. \n        It consists of sequence of symbols that are executed on the system. \n        The execution of a test case either fails or passes.\n    Test suite\n    Multiple test cases can be bundles into a test suite, which can also be nested.\n        If a test suite is executed, all of its containing test cases and test suites are executed recursively. \n        The execution succeeds if all test cases pass, otherwhise it fails.\n\n\n\nWorkflow\nRoughly speaking, the functionality of ALEX can be separated in two aspects: testing and learning.\nThe following diagram illustrates the basic workflow.\n\n    \n\n\nAs you can see, the difference between testing and learning is that while tests either pass or fail to execute, a behavioral model is generated while learning.\nIn this user manual, we will go deeper into the single steps listed in the diagram.\nFrontend\nStarting from the entry URL of ALEX, the graphical client can be accessed under http://localhost:;. \nFrom there on, the following URLs lead to different aspects of the application.\n\n\n\nURL\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n/\nThe home screen to login and create new users\n\n\n/about\nAn

ALEX is started, a default admin account is created which you can use instantly to login.\nThe account is:\n\n    Email:        admin@alex.example\n    Password: admin\n\n\n\nLogging into ALEX\n\nThe picture above shows the start page of ALEX. \nYou can either create a new account 1 or sign in 2 with an existing account.\nIn both cases, all you need to enter is an email address and a password.\nUpdating the user profile\n\nOnce you are logged in, you can edit your user profile by clicking on the \"Settings\" item in the sidebar in the group labeled \"User\".\nHere, you can change your email address, your password or delete your account permanently.\nAdmin user management\nAdmins also have the possibility to manage all existing users that are registered.\nTherefore, click on the item \"User Management\".\n\nA click on 1 reveals a modal window (see the picture below) where the corresponding actions on a user can be performed.\nNote that, as an admin, you can only delete your own account or change your role to REGISTERED if there is another user with admin rights in the system.\nThe button 2 lets admins create new users.\n"},"contents/user-manual/application-settings.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/application-settings.html","title":"Application settings","keywords":"","body":"Application settings\nThere are some global, application specific settings that only users with admin rights have access to.\nWebDrivers\nFor testing and learning web applications, we use Selenium to interact with web browsers. \nPer default, only the headless WebDriver HTMLUnit and Safari are supported since they do not require a user to download executables that enable Selenium to communicate with them.\nNote that Safari is only supported if ALEX is running on a MacOS system. \nOtherwise, the option is still displayed, but will not work for testing or learning.\n\nFor other web browsers, namely Chrome, Firefox and Edge, driver executables have to be downloaded.\nWe provide links to the download pages, but you have to make sure that the version of the executable supports the version of the web browser you have installed.\nAfter you have downloaded an executable, enter the absolute path to the file in the corresponding input field, as depicted in 1.\nIn Linux systems, there might be an error that saying that the driver executable is not executable.\nThen, change the permissions of the file e.g. like chmod +x chromedriver.\nYou can also define a browser which is used for testing and learning per default.\nTherefore, a dropdown menu on the bottom of the page 2 lets you select a web browser.\nDo not forget to save the changes you have made 3.\nFurther, using the Edge browser on Linux and MacOS is not supported, and also Safari is not supported on Linux and Windows systems.\nThe option is still visible, but using a web browser on an operating system that does not support it will result in errors.\nUser registration\n\nIf you have ALEX installed in your network, you may not want the registration process to be available for anyone.\nYou can enable and disable public user registration by checking or unchecking the provided input on the bottom of the page.\nBe aware that you, as an admin, can also create new users manually in the user management.\n"},"contents/user-manual/project-management.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/project-management.html","title":"Project management","keywords":"","body":"Project management\nProjects are

At least one URL is required.\n(yes)\n\n\nDescription\nA description of your project.\nno\n\n\n\nThe URL of a new project has to start with http:// or https:// followed by at least one further character for the host. \nThe URL can, but does not have to end with a trailing '/'. \nFor performance reasons, a local installation of the target application is recommended.\nYou can specify more than one URL if you have multiple instances of the same applications.\nOne of the URLs has to be specified as Default which is used by default when learning or executing tests.\nSpecifying more than one URL is useful for parallelizing aspects of the learning process, thus, making it faster.\nIt is important that these replications do not share the same state, e.g. have their own database.\n\nIf you want to edit a project, click on 1 and a modal window will pop up where the same form as for the creation is displayed.\nDeleting and updating projects can be done under the premise that there is no active learning process with the project.\nBefore deleting a project, make sure you have exported your symbols, hypotheses and/or statistics because with the deletion of a project, all these entities are deleted from the database, too.\nWorking with a project\nMost aspects of ALEX require that a project is opened, which means that is has been selected from the project list. \nIt is then saved in the sessionStorage of the web browser, so that, in case of a page refresh, the project does not have to be opened again. \nYou can select a project you want to work with it by clicking on 2 which will redirect you to the dashboard of the project (see picture below).\n\nThe dashboard displays some information about the project itself, an indicator for the state of a running learning process and a quick link to the latest learner result.\nIn order to switch to another project you have to close the current one first. \nThe button for this action can be found in the menu under the navigation point with the name of the opened project 3. \nIt redirects back to the project overview. \nSince the current project is persisted per tab, working on multiple projects simultaneously is possible by loading ALEX in another browser tab.\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/","title":"Symbol modeling","keywords":"","body":"Symbol management\nThe modelling of input symbols is a key aspect of using ALEX.\nThey define interactions with the system under learning and thus are the building blocks of every learning process and test case.\n\nOnce you have logged in and opened a project, click on 1 to open the view for the symbol management.\nSymbol groups\nSymbol groups are logical container for symbols.\nPer default, there is a default group that is created during the creation of the project.\nThe default group can not be deleted, and all symbols, if not specified otherwise, are put into it.\nYou can create a new group by clicking on 2 and select the corresponding item from the dropdown menu.\nYou are then asked for a name for the group, which has to be unique.\nOnce a group has been created, you can edit and delete it, by clicking on the gear icon that is found on the right.\nSymbols\nWhen creating a new symbol (see 2), you have to specify two properties:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nA unique name of the symbol\n\n\nSymbol group\nThe group the symbol belongs to. Per default, the default group of the project is used.\n\n\n\nOnce the symbol has been created successfully, it appears in the specified group.\nFor each symbol, there is a list of operations that are accessible by clicking on the menu 3 of which most are self explanatory.\nIn the menu on top of the page, these operations are available for a batch of symbols.\nEach symbol contains of a sequence of actions, that are managed in a separate view.\nClick on the link below the symbol name or the item Actions in menu 3 to open the action management for the symbol, which is covered in this section.\nSearching symbols\n\nDirectly below the action bar, a search input is displayed which you can use to quickly find symbols.\nA click on a result redirects you to the symbol page.\nRestoring archived symbols\nOnce you archived a symbol, it is not really removed from the database, instead, they are put into the symbol archived.\nSymbols cannot be deleted permanently, because they still might be referenced by e.g. learner results or test cases you have created.\n\nYou can see all archived symbols in the archive overview which can be accessed via the item Archive in the sidebar.\nHere you can do here is to recover symbols or edit their name.\nA recovered symbol is then moved into the default group.\nExport & import\nIf you want to save a set of symbols for another project or use existing ones, ALEX offers an export and import feature.\nNote that existing symbol groups are not exported in order to be compatible with other projects.\n\nIn order to export symbols, select the corresponding symbols in the overview and click on the export button 1.\nYou are then asked for name of the JSON file which will be downloaded.\nAdditionally, you can decide if only the selected symbols are exported, or if the symbol groups that they are in are exported as well.\n\nIn the same view, you can import existing symbols from a JSON file by clicking on 2 which opens a modal window.\nHere, drag and drop the JSON file you exported in the previous step.\nThe import will not work unless the names of the symbols are unique within the project.\nIf everything goes fine, the modal window will close automatically and the symbols appear in the selected group.\nSymbol parameters\n\nSymbols have input and output parameters for variables and counters (see next section for more information).\n\nVariables and counters are read from and written into and a global store during a membership query, see the image above.\nBefore a variable or counter can be used in a symbol, it has to be defined in as input parameter for the symbol.\nLocal modifications of variables and counters do not affect the global context unless they are written back as output.\nIf you use a variable or a counter that has not been defined, the execution of the symbols fails and the output is: Undefined variable: Name, or Undefined counter: Name respectively.\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/actions.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/actions.html","title":"Actions","keywords":"","body":"Actions\nThe function of a symbol is defined by its actions and their execution order. \nAn action can be understood as an atomic interaction with a system, like clicking on a button, submitting a form, making an HTTP request to a REST API and so on.\n\nIn the actions view of a symbol, the sequence of actions, which can be rearranged via drag and drop, is displayed.\nEverything you do here is not saved automatically.\nInstead, a notification on the top 3 notifies you that something has changed.\nA click on the Save button saves the action and you are safe to navigate to another page.\n\nA click on the create button opens a modal window, where, on the left, the list of all possible actions is listed.\nOn the right, the form for a selected action is displayed. \nWith 4 you can search for an action by its name instead of searching it in the list.\nEach action can be marked with three different flags which are\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnegated\nNegates the outcome of an action.\n\n\nignoreFailure\nIf this flag is set to \"true\" proceeding actions are executed although the action failed.\n\n\ndisabled\nIf this flag is set to \"true\" its execution is skipped during the call of its symbol. 2\n\n\n\nNormally, the output of a system is either \"Ok\" or \"Failed\" depending on success of the execution of the symbol.\nIf this is not expressive enough, you can also specify a custom failure output of each action that is propagated to the symbol.\nInsert the custom output in 6 (image above).\nIn this field, dynamic values can be inserted as well (see section about variables and counters below).\nIn the overview, you see another input field for the custom success output of the symbol.\nThe value that is inserted here will be the output in case all actions can be executed successfully.\nNote that there can be dynamic outputs as well via variables and counters (see below).\n\nA useful feature is that you can also use copy, cut and paste operations on actions, if e.g. symbols behave similar.\nThe option for this can be found in the dropdown menu on the right of each action or for a batch operation on selection actions in the action bar on top 7.\nIn the next sections, we go a little deeper into the single categories of actions.\nWeb actions\nWeb actions are used to interact with a browser interface like a normal user would. \nThey are based on Selenium and ALEX offers a subset of the Selenium functionality that are presented in the table below.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAlert - Accept/Dismiss\nAccepts or dismisses an alert dialog.\n\n\nAlert - Get Text\nSave the displayed text of an alert/confirm/prompt window in a variable.\n\n\nAlert - Send keys\nSend user input to a prompt alert.\n\n\nBrowser\nRefresh or restart the browser instance.\n\n\nCheck Attribute\nChecks the value of an attribute of an element\n\n\nCheck Node\nCheck if a certain element is present on the website.\n\n\nCheck Node Selected\nCheck if a radio button, a checkbox or an option in a select box is selected.\n\n\nCheck Text\nCheck if a certain text is part of the website body.\n\n\nCheck Title\nChecks if the page title is a certain string.\n\n\nClear\nClear an input field.\n\n\nClick\nClick or double click on an element.\n\n\nClick Link By Text\nClick on a link with a specific text value.\n\n\nExecute JavaScript\nExecute a JavaScript snipped in the page.\n\n\nFill\nClear and fill an input field with some text.\n\n\nOpen URL\nRequest a specific site.\n\n\nMove Mouse\nMove the cursor to a specific element or coordinates\n\n\nPress Key\nPress a special key on the keyboard\n\n\nSubmit\nSubmit a form.\n\n\nSelect\nSelect an option form an select input field.\n\n\nSwitch to\nSwitch back to the parent content or the default content from another frame.\n\n\nSwitch to Frame\nSwitch the Selenium context to another frame.\n\n\nWait for Attribute\nWait until an attribute of an element has or contains a specific value.\n\n\nWait for Text\nWait until a specific text is visible on the website.\n\n\nWait for Title\nWait until the title of a page changes.\n\n\nWait for Node\nWait until the state of an element changes.\n\n\n\nMore detailed information about the parameters of each web action is omitted here, since the forms in the frontend should be labeled sufficiently.\nIf you play around a little with the action editor, you may realize that most web actions require you to enter a CSS or an XPath expression to an element. \nThis may be not that easy to find out in case you are not very familiar with HTML, CSS or XPath. \nSo, there is a button that is labeled with \"Element Picker\". \nThis is a special feature of ALEX for extracting selectors elements from your website directly without having to know HTML.\nVisit this section to see how the use the element picker.\nREST actions\nREST actions are the counterpart to web actions. They are used to communicate with REST APIs. \nThe table below shows a list of available actions.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCheck Attribute\nCheck if the response has an specific attribute.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Type\nCheck if an attribute in the response has a specific type.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Value\nCheck if an attribute in the response has a specific value.\n\n\nCheck Header Field\nCheck if the response has a certain header field.\n\n\nCheck Status\nCheck if a previous response returned the expected HTTP status.\n\n\nMake Request\nMakes an HTTP request\n\n\nSearch in Body\nSearch for a piece of text in the HTTP response body.\n\n\nValidate JSON\nValidate the body of a response against a JSON schema.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that working with HTTP requests and responses follows a certain pattern. \nNormally, you make a request and analyze the results. \nThe order of your REST actions should also look like that. \nStart with a Make Request action and use other actions to work with the response.\nThe context of the Make Request action, namely the HTTP response, is passed to the following actions until the next Make Request action is made.\nGeneral actions\nActions of this group allow the interaction between different symbols and actions, for example by storing and passing String and Integer values to other actions.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAssert Counter\nAsserts the value of a counter.\n\n\nAssert Variable\nAsserts the value of a variable.\n\n\nIncrement Counter\nIncrement a counter by a given value.\n\n\nSet Counter\nSet a counter to a new value.\n\n\nSet Variable\nSet a variable to a new value.\n\n\nSet Variable by Cookie\nSet a variable to the value of a cookie\n\n\nSet Variable by HTML Element\nSet a variable to a value form a website element.\n\n\nSet Variable by HTTP Response\nSet a variable to the body of a HTTP response.\n\n\nSet Variable by JSON Attribute\nSet a variable to a value form a JSON response.\n\n\nSet Variable by Node Attribute\nSet a variable to the value of an attribute of an element.\n\n\nSet Variable by Node Count\nSet a variable to the number of elements matching a selector.\n\n\nSet Variable by Regex Group\nSet a variable to a group in a regex match.\n\n\nWait\nWait for a specific amount of time.\n\n\n\nVariables, counters and files\nMany web applications handle dynamic data and allow file uploads. \nIn order to model and learn such behaviors and to pass data between symbols, actions and learn processes, variables, counters and files can be used.\n\n    Variables\n    \n        Variables contain (also empty) String values and are kept alive for a single membership query.\n    \n    Counters\n    \n        Counters are positive integer values that are persisted in the database per project. \n        They can be incremented and modified at will using corresponding actions. \n        Usually, they are used to create multiple objects of the same kind, e.g. user1, user2, ... and so on. \n        Further, counters can help to model a system reset and thereby allow a consecutive execution of multiple learn processes without having to manually reset the application in between every test.\n    \n    Files\n    \n        In order to learn websites that allow its users to upload files, this feature can be used as well.\n        See this page for a more detailed description and their usage.\n    \n\n\nIn order to make use of those in actions, there is a small template language that has to be used in action fields:\n\n\n\nNotation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n{{#counterName}}\nThe value of the counter with the name counterName is inserted\n\n\n{{$variableName}}\nThe value of the variable with the name variableName is inserted\n\n\n{{\\filename.ext}}\nThe absolute path of the file filename.ext is inserted\n\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates the usage of variables.\nThe process can be transferred easily for counters and files.\n\nAssume we have an application that manages todo items and the element with the selector #new-todo is the input field that allows a user to create a new item.\nWe now want to insert the content of the item dynamically via a variable.\nFirst, create an action that sets the value of the variable.\nAs you can see in the picture above, there are some choices for how to do this.\n\nThen, we create another action that inserts the value of the variable into the element #new-todo.\nIn the input field for the value, we use the notation from the table above to indicate that we want to insert the value of the variable todoName.\nAs soon as the action is executed, the value of todoName is inserted automatically. \nIn the todo list, a todo with the text \"buy milk\" would appear in the application.\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/element-picker.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/element-picker.html","title":"Element picker","keywords":"","body":"Element Picker\nFor modeling actions that interact with the web browser, we need to specify the unique selector to the element we want to interact with.\nA HTML document usually looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Link A\n    Link B\n  \n\n\n\nFor example, the first link has an ID, so the selector would simply be #link.\nThe second link does not have an ID, so the selector corresponds to the path from the body (or a parent element with an ID) to that element.\nHere, the selector for the second link would be body > div:nth-child(1) > a:nth-child(2) which reads as the second direct child \"a\" node in the first direct child \"div\" node of the body.\nAs you can imagine, websites are not necessarily structured that simple and elements are nested deeply.\nThe deeper an element that has no ID is in the tree, the longer and therefore more complex the selector to that element might be.\nWriting these selectors by hand is error prone and unnecessary hard.\nBecause of this, we offer a feature we call Element Picker which extracts the selector of an element automatically.\n\nTo use the element picker while creating an action, click on the corresponding button 1.\n\nThe element picker pops up and loads the web application that you specified in the project into an iframe.\nPer default, you will get a message in the header that you see in the image above.\nNormally, web browsers deny access to the structure of the website inside of an iframe due to security reasons.\nIn order to use the element picker as intended, follow the following instructions and restart the web browser:\n\n\n\nBrowser\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nFirefox\nInstall a plugin like CORS Everywhere\n\n\nChrome\nStart chrome with disabled web security parameters: --disable-web-security --user-data-dir or install a similar plugin\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the element picker will look like displayed above.\nStart the selection by clicking on the button with the toggle icon 2.\nThe button on the right lets you switch between the CSS selector and an equivalent XPath expression.\n\nSelect an element by moving your mouse over the target element, which is highlighted with a big, red border 3.\nIn the header, the selector to the element is displayed.\nIf you are satisfied with the selection, just click on the element.\n\nFinally, accept your selection by clicking on 4 or start over.\n\nThe selector, and in some cases other data is automatically inserted into the corresponding input field 5 of the action.\nSelecting elements in the web browser\nIf you encounter issues with the element picker, you can also use your favourite web browser to get the selectors of elements.\nHere, the usage of Chrome for this is demonstrated, but the procedure can be transferred to other web browsers as well.\n\nFirst, right click on the target element and click on \"Inspect\" 1.\n\nThis will open the developer tools of the web browser which displays the structure of the website and highlights the corresponding element in blue.\nPerform a right click on the highlighted element and navigate to \"Copy > Copy selector\" 2 or \"Copy XPath\".\nThe unique selector to the element is copied into the clipboard and can be pasted into the input field in ALEX.\n\n    In Firefox, the extracted selector might not be unique, so use them with caution.\n\n"},"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/action-recorder.html":{"url":"contents/user-manual/symbol-modeling/action-recorder.html","title":"Recording

EQ oracle approximates an equivalence query by generating random words from the input alphabet and executes them on the system. \n        The oracles expects three parameters: minLength (> 0) defines the minimum length of a generated word, maxLength (>= minLength) the maximum length and numberOfWords (> 0) the amount of randomly generated words to test.\n    \n    Complete\n    \n        The Complete EQ oracle generates all possible words from an alphabet within some limits. \n        minDepth (> 0) describes the minimum length of word, maxDepth (>= minDepth) the maximum length.\n    \n    W-Method\n        \n            The W-Method EQ oracle generates words based on a transition coverage of the graph under the assumption of maxDepth additional states.\n        \n    Sample\n    \n        If this oracle is chosen, counterexamples are searched and specified manually by the user.\n    \n    Hypothesis\n    \n        Uses an ideal model of an application to search for differences and uses them as counterexamples.\n        Note that the input alphabets should be the same.\n    \n\n\nThe input field for the maximum amount of steps to learn indicates how many intermediate hypotheses the learner has to generate before the learning process is stopped.\nThe value -1 means that the learner stops if no more counterexample is found.\nAnother value, for example 3, would stop the learner after having generated three hypotheses, although this might not be the final one.\nOf cause, if the final hypothesis is learned before those three steps, the learner stops beforehand.\nThis way, it is possible to e.g. learn the first three steps with a randomized equivalence oracle and then continue learning with another one.\nIn the WebDriver tab (right) you can configure which web browser is used for accessing the target web application during the learning process.\nEach web driver has individual options which are displayed once you select a web browser from the select input.\n\n    Xvfb

written down. \nThese rely on our own experiences while modeling and learning several web applications.\nSymbol modeling\nWhen modeling input symbols, the granularity of modeling your application matters and it is advised that you think in use cases. \nHere is the reason why:\nFor example, if you create an input symbol for each possible click on each link or button, you will have a very detailed and big model of your application's behavior.\nHowever, the verification of specifications will not be that easy.\nAdditionally, learning will usually take much longer as the number of symbols grows.\nIn contrast to that, you should not treat a symbol as a whole integration test. \nFor example you could create a symbol TestAuthenticationSystem that creates a user, logs him in and then out. \nThis has several disadvantages. \nYou do not test at any other point of your application if a logout is possible without explicitly modeling it twice. \nFurthermore, the learned model will most likely not represent your real system very accurately.  \nInstead, we think it is good if you create something in between those extremes. \nAs already mentioned, try modelling use cases of your application. \nAs an example, have a look at Wordpress. \nPossible symbols could be:\n\nLogin\nLogout\nCreate a post\nPublish a post\nMark a comment as spam\n...\n\nEach point can be modeled as an input symbol and the learned model will tell you clearly what is possible and what is not while still be able to easily find possible errors in an application.\nModeling authentication systems\nBasic HTTP Auth\n\nThe Make request action and the Open URL action both support the specification of credentials, consisting of a login and a password, in order to use basic HTTP auth.\nJSON Web Tokens (JWT)\n\nJWTs are usually used to authenticate against REST APIs by sending an encoded token in the Authorization header, like Authorization: Bearer . \nIn ALEX, you can specify HTTP headers in the Make request action.\nIt usually makes sense to store the JWT in a variable and let ALEX insert it dynamically, like in the image above.\nCookie-based authentication\nIn the Make request and in the Open URL action you can specify both, cookies and additional HTTP header fields, if necessary.\nA common method to use cookies is to authenticate via the web interface and use the cookie for REST requests.\nIn order to model this, first model the login behavior via the web interface.\nThen, use the Set variable by cookie action with the Browser cookie option to save the cookie.\nAfter that, the cookie is stored in a available and can be used in the Make request action.\nResetting an application\nWhile learning, sequences of symbols are created and executed on your application. \nWe assume that your application behaves input deterministically, i.e. each sequence that is executed will always yield the same output. \nAs a consequence, for each sequence, the system has to be put in a state where all further executions are independent from the ones before.\nPractically, this can be done by resetting the system.\nIn ALEX, the reset mechanism is modeled as a symbol that by convention we call Reset.\nWhat a reset looks like is up to you and depends on the application, but here are some examples:\n\nIf you have a static web site that only consists of a few linked HTML files and you want to make sure they are linked correctly, the reset symbol could consist of an action to go to the index page.\n\nIf you have a user management system and want to test user specific features only, your reset symbol could simply consist of the creation of a new user. \nFor example if you want to test a users ability to create, update and delete a business entity, then, a reset could create a new user and log him in. \nIf he now creates a entity, his action does not interfere with actions executed by other users.\n\nSometimes it may be necessary to clear the database in order to remove all entities. \nSince we have no actions that connects to a database to execute queries you will have to work around that, e.g. by \n\ncreating a temporary REST endpoint that is called that resets the database, or by \nadding a button to the frontend that is hidden in the admin panel that does the same.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, how you model a system reset is not always trivial and is highly dependant on how the target application works and what exactly you want to test.\nLearning process configuration\nBefore you start a learning process, you can configure some parameters like the algorithm or the equivalence oracle. \nALEX runs all tests with reasonable preconfigured settings.\nHere are some advices:\n\nThe TTT algorithm usually performs best.\nThe default settings for the Random Word equivalence oracle is ok for models that you do not expect to get bigger than 4 to 6 states. \nThere is no real rule of thumb here, but if you expect your models to be bigger that that, adjust the parameters correspondingly.\nThe complete and W-method equivalence oracle can be used when you can run your tests over night or the weekend, or for a really small alphabet size. \nEnabling the membership query cache is preferred.\nProvide multiple URLs during the project creation so that equivalence oracles and some algorithms can perform better.\n\nLearning JavaScript enabled applications\n\nWhen modeling symbols for JavaScript heavy websites, e.g. single page applications, make use of the wait for ... actions. \nThis way, Selenium can handle dynamic changes of the DOM better.\n\nFurther remarks\n\n\nSometimes, you might get a cryptic error message while learning (like in the image above) that says something like: expected symbol ok ok failed(1) but got symbol ok failed(2) ok.\nThis means that the same query resulted in two different system outputs, which indicates that the system does not behave deterministically.\nMore often, the real reason is one of the following:\n\nThe reset does not really reset the application.\nFaulty symbol modeling, triggered by a counter that has not been incremented or something like that.\nSelenium behaves off which mostly happens in single page applications.\nRefactor the modeling of the symbol that leads to the error, e.g. increase timeouts.\nYour system is fully occupied, thus the web browser needs longer to react than the timeouts that are specified.\nThe driver executable fails to connect to the web browser, which can happen at times.\nThe only solution here is to continue learning from the last known hypothesis.\n\n\n\n"},"contents/cli/":{"url":"contents/cli/","title":"CLI","keywords":"","body":"ALEX CLI\nALEX offers a command line interface (cli) for executing tests and starting learning

Only works in the build module. See the Docker section below.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the following parameters can be used for the build file or the mvn spring-boot:run command:\n\n\n\nArgument\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nalex.dbpath\nThe path where the HSQLDB is stored.  java -jar alex-1.5.0.war --alex.dbpath=mem:testdb respectively   mvn spring-boot:run \"-Dalex.dbpath=mem:testdb\"\n\n\nalex.port\nThe path where ALEX should run  java -jar alex-1.5.0.war --alex.port=8000 respectively mvn spring-boot:run \"-Dalex.port=8000\"\n\n\nchromeDriver\nThe absolute path to the Chrome driver executable on your system\n\n\nedgeDriver\nThe absolute path to the Edge driver executable on your system\n\n\nfirefoxDriver\nThe absolute path to the Gecko driver executable on your system\n\n\nremoteDriver\nThe URI to the remote Selenium server\n\n\n\nDocker\nAnother way to use ALEX involves Docker.\nMake sure that Docker is installed on your machine and that you have the right permissions to use it.\nThen, execute the following commands from the root of the repository to create a docker image:\n# must be executed once\nmvn install [-DskipTests]\n\n# build the image\ncd build\nmvn docker:build\n\nAfterwards a Docker image is created and you use it like any other Docker image, e.g.\n# run ALEX at http://localhost:8000\ndocker run -d -p 8000:8080 alex:1.X.X\n\nThe corresponding Dockerfile can be found at /build/src/docker\nFrontend development\nThe frontend is developed with AngularJS and uses ES6 features using the babel transpiler.\nStyling in ALEX is done with Bootstrap v3 and custom SASS stylesheets.\nAll frontend files can be found in frontend/src/main/javascript.\nRequirements\n\nNode.js v10 and NPM v6\n\nNPM commands\nThere are several NPM commands to automate the development workflow.\nIn the frontend/src/main/javascript directory, use the following commands:\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnpm run build\nBuild all the application files\n\n\nnpm run serve\nServes the frontend at http://localhost:8080.  For a custom port, add -- -p XXXX\n\n\nnpm run dev\nCompile sass, html and js files every time their content changes\n\n\nnpm run lint\nCheck JavaScript code formatting\n\n\nnpm test\nExecute all unit tests\n\n\n\nRunning the frontend\nSince the frontend and the backend are decoupled from each other, we have to configure the address of the backend, so that all HTTP requests go to the correct server. \nEdit the file environments.js accordingly:\n// environments.js\n\n// use this before packaging ALEX using 'mvn package'\nexport const apiUrl = '/rest';\n\n// use this for local development when frontend and backend run separately\n// export const apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/rest';\n\nFor the local development, uncomment the second line and adjust the port where the backend is running on.\nIf you want to build ALEX later, the variable has to point to /rest again.\nAuthentication with the REST API\nThe REST API of ALEX supports authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).\n\nMake a POST request to /rest/users/login with a HTTP body that contains a serialized user object which looks like {\"email\":\"\", \"password\":\"\"}.\nYou should receive a base64 encoded JWT. Save it somewhere and send it with each HTTP request to the API in the HTTP-Authorization header as follows: Authorization: Bearer .\n\nThe token provides information about the user as a base64 encoded JSON object as payload.\nIt looks like {\"email\": \"\", \"id\":  \"role\": \"\"} where the role is either ADMIN or REGISTERED.\nThat's it. \nCurrently, the password is transferred in plain text since there is no HTTPS connection available.\n"},"contents/developer-documents/REST.html":{"url":"contents/developer-documents/REST.html","title":"REST API","keywords":"","body":"REST

accessible over the internet?  \nYes, you can, but really should not do that, since testing usually takes a lot of traffic, and your test targets may not like it. \nBut we do not programmatically prohibit it either. \nThe primary use case is to use ALEX for testing applications that are installed locally or in the same network.\nDo I really not have to have any programming experience?  \nWe made best efforts to abstract all necessary steps to test a web application with ease. \nWhile modeling tests for your application, it may be helpful to have basic understanding of HTML and CSS. \nThe same goes for modelling REST tests where it is required that you have basic understanding of the JSON format. \nHow potent does my system have to be to run tests?  \nLearning is a CPU and memory intense process, but we give an lower bound for your system specs. \nFrom our own observations, it is advised to have at least 4Gb of RAM and a relatively modern Dual Core CPU to run tests at a satisfiable performance. \nThe more power your system has, the faster your tests should (ideally) execute.\nI want to learn a specific feature of my application but ALEX does not provide a way to model it. What can I do?  \nInitially, we did not develop ALEX as a solution to all situations that may occur in a web application, but to the most common ones.\nIf you think a key feature is missing, feel free to submit an issue or create a pull request on GitHub and we will see what we can do. \n"}}}
