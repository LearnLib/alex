<p>Here we present a detailed explanation of the concepts and ways to use ALEX.
If you find bugs of any kind relating this application or inaccuracies in this manual,
<a href="mailto:alexander.bainczyk@tu-dortmund.de,alexander.schieweck@tu-dortmund.de" target="_blank">let us</a> know.</p>
<h2 id="description-and-features">Description and Features</h2>
<p>ALEX offers a simplicity-oriented way to model and execute learning experiments for web applications and web services
using active automata learning. Based on the function set of the <a href="http://learnlib.de/" title="LearnLib" target="_blank">LearnLib</a>
and inspired by the <a href="http://ls5-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/projects/learnlib/download.php" target="_blank">LearnLib Studio</a> the
application lays a focus on the ease to use of the tool while offering an extensive feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inferring Mealy machines of web applications and web services using active automata learning techniques</li>
<li>Support for managing and learning multiple applications</li>
<li>Graphical symbol construction</li>
<li>Graphical learn process modelling</li>
<li>Automatic generation and visualization of<ul>
<li>Hypotheses</li>
<li>Internal data structures (Observation table and Discrimination tree)</li>
<li>Statistics regarding learn results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simultaneous learning of web applications and web services</li>
<li>Algorithms: L*, TTT, Discrimination Tree, DHC, Kearns &amp; Vazirani</li>
<li>Equivalence oracles: Random Word, Complete, Sample, W-Method, Hypothesis</li>
<li>Import and export of symbol sets and projects</li>
<li>Export of hypotheses as JSON and SVG</li>
<li>Export of internal data structures</li>
<li>Export of statistics</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-objects">Working Objects</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>Project</dt>
    <dd>A project is the main object that the following objects belong to. It is bound to a unique name and a URL that
    starts with *&quot;http\[s\]://&quot;*. This property defines the root URL of the application under testing. In ALEX it is
    allowed to create and manage multiple projects, thus, for example, allowing to treat a web application and a web
    service as different projects or managing multiple complete different applications. A project can have multiple URLs
    where *the same* application can be accessed to make use of parallelisation techniques.</dd>
    <dt>Symbol Group</dt>
    <dd>Each project has a list of symbol groups. Symbol groups are logical container for symbols. They allow to group 
    symbols, for example by their purpose or a feature. They are defined by a unique name. For every project, there is 
    a default group with the name <em>&quot;Default Group&quot;</em> which can not be deleted.</dd>
    <dt>Symbol</dt>
    <dd>Symbols are used by the learner to learn an application. They are defined by a unique name and an abbreviation.
    The latter is shown as an edge label of the inferred model to make it visually clear. Each symbol
    consists of an ordered list of actions that define the actual logic of the symbol once it is executed.</dd>
    <dt>Action</dt>
    <dd>Actions are atomic operations on an application. In ALEX, there are three types. <strong>Web</strong> actions are
    inspired by Selenium and directly interact with the web interface of an application that is for example is clicking a
    button, filling out input fields and submitting forms. <strong>REST</strong> actions allow to define actions with
    a REST API and <strong>General actions allow interoperability between actions and symbols.</strong></dd>
    <dt>Learn Configuration</dt>
    <dd>For each learn process, a learn configuration has to be created. It consists of an alphabet, which is a set
    of created symbols, a reset symbol (a symbol that is used to reset an application before each MQ), a learn
    algorithm, an equivalence oracle and some other parameters. Of cause the length the alphabet has to contain at 
    least one symbol and reset symbol is required as well.</dd>
    <dt>Learn Result</dt>
    <dd>As soon as a learn process has finished, a learn result is generated for each step the learner took to generate
    the final hypothesis. For each step, it contains the actual learn configuration, statistics and the hypothesis as
    a JSON representation.</dd>
</dl>


<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>When working with ALEX, the workflow for learning a web application starting with the creation of a project and resulting
in the generation of a model of this application follows a common pattern. The next chapters deal with an in-depth view
on the points listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a project with the root URL where the target application can be accessed</li>
<li>Optionally create several symbol groups</li>
<li>Create a set of symbols, including one that handles the reset logic</li>
<li>Create actions for each symbol</li>
<li>Configure a learning process and start learning</li>
<li>Display the hypothesis, internal data structures, analyze the statistics</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="frontend">Frontend</h2>
<p>Starting from the entry URL of ALEX, the graphical client can be accessed under http:/localhost:\<port\>/app. From there
on the following URLs lead to different parts of the application.</port\></p>

<p><em>Except for the about, help, error and the home page, all other routes require that a user is logged in and a project has been created and is opened.</em></p>
<h3 id="user-management">User Management</h3>
<p>There are two roles in ALEX: <em>ADMIN</em> and <em>USER</em> where admins are allowed to update and delete normal users. 
At the first start a default admin account is created which you can use instantly to login into the application:</p>
<p>Email: &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <em>admin@alex.example</em><br>
Password: <em>admin</em></p>
<h3 id="application-settings">Application Settings</h3>
<p>There are some global application specific settings only admins can edit.</p>
<h4 id="webdriver">Webdriver</h4>
<p>For learning web applications, we use Selenium to interact with web browsers. 
Per default, only the headless HTMLUnitDriver is supported, but it does not work very well with websites that make heavy use of JavaScript.
Luckily, there are third party drivers, that allow executing tests on Firefox, Chrome etc. 
In order to use them, you have to download the corresponding executables and specify them in ALEX on the settings page as depicted in the following image (here for Windows):</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/settings.jpg" alt="Comparison of hypotheses"></p>
<h3 id="project-management">Project Management</h3>
<p>Projects are the entities that are used to manage multiple target applications in ALEX. You can for example create
a project for your application in version x and another one for version x+1 while having a different sets of input symbols.</p>
<p>Most of the URLs listed in the previous section require a project to be <em>opened</em>, which means has been selected from the
applications start page. It is then saved in the session storage of the web browser. In case a project is persisted no
other project can be opened in the same tab. The use of multiple tabs allows to open and work with multiple projects at a
time. In order to switch to another project of the same tab, it has to be <em>closed</em>. That means it has to be removed from
the session storage, either by clicking the menu item from the main navigation or by closing the current tab.</p>

<p>The URL of a new project has to start with <em>http://</em> or <em>https://</em> followed by at least one further character for the
host. Technically, any host can be entered and therefore any web site can be learned. Due to the traffic that is caused
by the learn process, it is recommended to only learn web applications you are the owner of, be it a local or a
remote host.</p>
<p>If the creation has been successful a user should be redirected to the front page where the newly created project is
now listed. A click on it opens the project and leads to a work in progress dashboard which is the entry point for every
other interaction with your project.</p>
<p>In order to switch to another project you have to close the current one at first. The button for this action can be
found in the menu under the navigation point with the name of the opened project. It redirects to the front-page. For
working on multiple projects simultaneously, you can open another tab and call ALEX from that one again.</p>
<p>Deleting and updating projects can be done under the premise that there is no active learn process with the project,
Before deleting a project, make sure you have exported your symbols, hypotheses and/or statistics because with the
deleting of a project, all these values are deleted from the server, too.</p>
<h4 id="export--import">Export &amp; Import</h4>
<p>In the project overview, you will find an entry in the dropdown menu beside each project that allows you to export the
corresponding project. Import it in the same view by clicking on the import tab. Then, drag the json file in the visible
field and click on the button \&quot;Import Project\&quot;. Change the name of the project in case there is already one with the
same name.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">Project export and import might be buggy.</div>


<h3 id="symbol-management">Symbol Management</h3>
<h4 id="symbol-groups">Symbol Groups</h4>
<p>With symbol groups symbols of a project can be organized. For example you can create a group that contains symbols that
are used to reset an application, another one for web related symbols and a further one for symbols relating to your
REST API, but it&apos;s completely up to you. <strong>Do not mistake a symbol group for an alphabet!</strong> A symbol group is just a
container for symbols and should help you organize them.</p>
<p>Symbol groups can be created, edited and deleted under the URL <em>/symbols</em>. In order to create a new one, hover over the
<em>create</em> button in the sub-navigation and click on the corresponding entry. In the modal window choose a unique name
for a symbol group. In order to change the name of a group or to delete it, click on the gear-button beside the symbol
group name and do these actions in the modal window.</p>
<p>ALEX offers a default group where new symbols are moved to if no other group is specified. It can not be deleted, but
renamed. Furthermore, deleting a symbol group induces all symbol to get deleted as well (more in the next chapter).</p>
<p>For a better overview over a large set of symbols, symbol groups can be collapsed by clicking on the arrow button on
the left of each entry.</p>
<h4 id="symbols">Symbols</h4>
<p>Symbols can be created, updated, deleted and moved into into other symbol groups. The creation of a symbol requires
several properties.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>A unique name of the symbol</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>abbreviation</td>
<td>A unique abbreviation with 15 characters at max. They are displayed in the hypotheses and should be named meaningfully</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>symbol group</td>
<td>Optionally the symbol group the symbol should be created in can be passed. If this property is not given, the symbol is moved to the default group</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that once you <em>delete</em> a symbol it is not permanently removed from the server, but hidden. As a consequence, they
can be made visible by going to <em>/symbols/trash</em> or by clicking the corresponding menu entry in the sidebar. There, a
list of all hidden symbols is given. Recovering a symbol makes it appear again in the group it previously was in. In
case the group has been deleted, the symbol is moved to the default group.</p>
<h4 id="actions">Actions</h4>
<p>The functionality of a symbol is defined by its actions and their execution order. An action can be understood as a real
interaction with a system, like clicking on buttons, submitting forms, making requests to an API and so on.</p>
<p>In order to manage actions of a single symbol, go to <em>/symbols/\<symbolid\>/actions</symbolid\></em> or click on the link below a symbol
under <em>/symbols</em>. Here, actions can be created, edited, deleted and ordered. The list that is shown represents the order
of execution on the application as soon as the symbol is called by the learner. Make sure to save changes that have been
made in the current session, since CRUD operations and re-ordering of actions is not saved automatically. This is simply
possible by clicking the <em>save</em> button on the right in the sub-menu.</p>
<p>The creation of actions is realized in a modal window that shows the action editor as shown in the picture above. As one
can see, the left column contains dropdown boxes with a logical grouping of actions. The right column reveals a form
with required input fields for a selected action. The action groups are presented in to following.</p>
<p>Each action can be marked with three different flags which are</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>negated</td>
<td>Negates the outcome of an action.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ignoreFailure</td>
<td>If this flag is set to &quot;true&quot; proceedings actions are executed although the action failed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>disabled</td>
<td>If this flag is set to &quot;true&quot; its execution is skipped during the call of its symbol</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5 id="web-actions">Web Actions</h5>
<p>Web actions are used to interact with a browser interface as a real person would do. They are based on Selenium actions
and ALEX offers a subset of these that are presented in the table below.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>More detailed information about all the parameters of each web action is omitted as this point, since the forms in the
front-end should be labeled sufficiently.</p>
<p>If you play around a little with the action editor, you may realize that most web actions require you to enter a CSS or
and XPath selector to an affected element. This may be not that easy to find out in case you are not very familiar with 
HTML. So, there is a button that is labeled with <em>&quot;Element Picker&quot;</em>. This is a special feature of ALEX for selecting 
HTML elements from your website directly without having to know HTML. Note that this only extracts CSS selectors.</p>
<h6 id="html-element-picker">HTML Element Picker</h6>
<p>The HTML element picker has been tested but it can not be ensured that picking the right element works in all possible
use cases. If the HTML picker should fail you can still get the CSS path of an element with the developer tools of your
browser.</p>
<p>In Google Chrome, make a right click on the desired element and choose the entry <em>Inspect Element</em>. The developer tools
sidebar should open and reveal the element in the DOM tree. There, make another right click on the element and choose
<em>Copy CSS Path</em> which copies the unique CSS selector in the clipboard of your operating system. A similar approach can
be applied with Firefox.</p>
<ol>
<li>Load a URL by entering a path relative to the base URL of the project in the URL bar on the top left.</li>
<li>Click on the button with the wand symbol. All elements should now get a thick red border as soon as you hover over it.</li>
<li>Click on the element you need the CSS path from. The selection mode should be disabled.</li>
<li>Click on the button with the label &quot;ok&quot; on the top right. The CSS path should automatically be entered in the correct
input element.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case that clicking on an element does not work as indented, probably because of some JavaScript, pressing the
&quot;Ctrl&quot; button on the keyboard has the same effect as a click, but does not fire a click event.</p>
<p>For some actions, like &quot;CheckText&quot;, the HTML element picker can be used as well. With the same method, it automatically
extracts the textContent value of an element and pastes the content to the corresponding input field. This also works
with the &quot;Fill&quot; action. Enter a value in the desired input field, select the element with the HTML element picker and it
extracts both, the value and the CSS path of it.</p>
<h5 id="rest-actions">REST Actions</h5>
<p>REST actions are the counterpart to web actions. They are used to communicate with RESTful interfaces. The table below
shows a list of available actions.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Call</td>
<td>Do a REST Call.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check Attribute Exists</td>
<td>Check if the response has an specific attribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check Attribute Type</td>
<td>Check if an attribute in the response has a specific type.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check Attribute Value</td>
<td>Check if an attribute in the response has a specific value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check Header Field</td>
<td>Check if the response has a certain header field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check Status</td>
<td>Check if a previous response returned the expected HTTP status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Check Text</td>
<td>Check the response body.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Keep in mind that working with HTTP requests and responses follows a certain pattern. Normally, you make a request and
analyze the results. The order of your REST actions should also look like that. Start with a <em>Call</em> action and use other
actions to work with the response.</p>
<h5 id="general-actions">General Actions</h5>
<p>Actions of this group allow the interaction between different symbols and actions, for example by storing and passing
String and Integer values to other actions.</p>

<h5 id="working-with-counters-variables-and-files">Working with Counters, Variables and Files</h5>
<p>Many web applications handle dynamic data and allow file uploads. In order to model and learn such behaviors and to
allow interaction between different symbols, actions and learn processes, <em>counters</em>, <em>variables</em> and <em>files</em> are
introduced.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Counter</dt>
    <dd>
        As the name indicates counters are integer values that are persisted in the database per project. They
        can be incremented and set at will. Commonly they are used to create multiple objects of the same kind. Counters
        can help to model a system reset and thereby allow a consecutive execution of multiple learn processes without
        having to manually reset the application in between every test.
    </dd>
    <dt>Variables</dt>
    <dd>
        Variables can only contain String values and are kept alive for a single membership query.
    </dd>
    <dt>Files</dt>
    <dd>
        In order to learn websites that allow its users to upload files, this feature can be used as well. Make sure the
        file that should be uploaded for learn purposes has been imported to the project of the website.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>In order to make use of those in actions, there is a notation that has to be used in action fields, as presented in the
following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Notation</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The value of the counter with the name <em>counterName</em> is inserted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The value of the variable with the name <em>variableName</em> is inserted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>The absolute path of the file <em>filename.ext</em> is inserted</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As an example for the use of counters and variables, let there be a variable <em>userName</em> with the value \&apos;<em>Admin</em>\&apos; and
a counter <em>countLogins</em> with the value \&apos;<em>5</em>\&apos;. The following symbol makes use of both.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">[{
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;name&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;symbol1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;abbreviation&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;s1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;actions&quot;</span> : [{
        <span class="hljs-string">&quot;type&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;web_checkForText&quot;</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">&quot;value&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello ! You logged in for the th time.&quot;</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">&quot;regexp&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
    }]
}, ... ]
</code></pre>
<p>As soon as the action is executed the value of the property \&apos;value\&apos; is parsed, the values for the variable <em>userName</em>
and the counter <em>countLogins</em> are inserted into the String. The resulting text that is searched for would be \&quot;<em>Hello
Admin! You logged in for the 5th time today.</em>\&quot;.</p>
<p>Normally, files are only applied to input fields with the type <em>\&quot;file\&quot;</em>, but do as you please. Given the following
element on a page</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">input</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;fileInput&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;file&quot;</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The action would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">[{
    ...
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;actions&quot;</span> : [{
        <span class="hljs-string">&quot;type&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;web_fill&quot;</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">&quot;node&quot;</span> : {
            <span class="hljs-string">&quot;selector&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;#fileInput&quot;</span>,
            <span class="hljs-string">&quot;type&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;CSS&quot;</span> 
        },
        <span class="hljs-string">&quot;value&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;</span>
    }]
}, ... ]
</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    Be aware that currently, due to the limitations of the used Selenium webdriver, the upload of files only works if
    a learn process is executed with enabled javascript, which is enabled by default.
</div>


<h4 id="export--import">Export &amp; Import</h4>
<p>If you want to save a set of symbols for another project or use already existing ones, the export and import function
might be of interest for you. Note that when exporting symbols, their id and group are deleted in order to be
compatible with other projects.</p>
<p>ALEX supports the import from and export in a JSON file. Technically, the possibility of creating symbols with a simple
text editor by hand and uploading them to the system is given. Therefore, the file has to look as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">[{
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;name&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;symbol1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;abbreviation&quot;</span> : <span class="hljs-string">&quot;s1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">&quot;actions&quot;</span> : [ ... ]
}, ... ]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="learning-experiment-modelling">Learning Experiment Modelling</h3>
<p>In order to start learning an application, a learn process has to be modeled. Such a process always consists of the
following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An input alphabet (set of symbols)</li>
<li>A symbol to reset the application</li>
<li>An algorithm</li>
<li>A parametrized equivalence oracle</li>
<li>A maximum amount of steps to learn</li>
<li>A specification of a web browser</li>
</ul>
<dl>
    <dt>Algorithm</dt>
    <dd>
        There are currently five algorithms supported: L*, Discrimination Tree, DHC, Kearns &amp; Vazirani and TTT.
    </dd>
    <dt>Equivalence oracle</dt>
    <dd>
        ALEX supports five kinds of oracles. Those are: <em>Random Word</em>, <em>Complete</em>, <em>W-Method</em>, <em>Sample</em> and <em>Hypothesis</em>. 
        The first three oracles approximate equivalence queries automatically to find counterexamples while when using
        <em>Sample</em>, you are asked to search and enter them by yourself in between iterations. 
        If the <em>Hypothesis</em> EQ oracle is used, the shortest separating word between the learned and the given model is used as counterexample.
        This however presumes that the alphabets of both models are equal.
    </dd>
    <dt>Steps to learn</dt>
    <dd>
        You can also define how many hypotheses should be generated at maximum. When the learner stops, you can still continue
        learning from this point.
    </dd>
    <dt>Comment</dt>
    <dd>
        Furthermore a comment can be added that makes it easier to identify a specific learn result between others. The
        comment is a string value with a maximum amount of 120 characters.
    </dd>
    <dt>Web driver</dt>
    <dd>
        Choose a web browser where the tests should be run in. 
        Per default, the headless HTML Unit Driver is selected. 
        For all others, make sure you have it installed, otherwise the application might crash.
        Also, define the size of the browser window. 
        If the height and width are set to <em>0px</em>, the web drivers predefined dimensions are used.
    </dd>
    <dt>Membership query cache</dt>
    <dd>
        If membership queries should be cached. Enabling this option often reduces the total learning time.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>The mentioned equivalence oracles have different strategies on how to find counterexamples. 
Each one can be configured with different parameters that define their behaviour.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Random Word</dt>
    <dd>
        The Random Word oracle approximates equivalence queries by generating random words from learned symbol set and
        executes them on the learned applications. The oracles expects three parameters: <em>minLength</em> defines the
        minimum length of a generated word, <em>maxLength</em> the maximum length and <em>numberOfWords</em> the amount
        of randomly generated words to test.
    </dd>
    <dt>Complete</dt>
    <dd>
        This oracle generates all possible word within some limits. <em>minDepth</em> describes the minimum length of
        a generated word, <em>maxDepth</em> the maximum length.
    </dd>
    <dt>Sample</dt>
    <dd>
        If this oracle is chosen, counterexamples are searched by hand by the user.
    </dd>
    <dt>W-Method</dt>
    <dd>
        Uses the W-Method introduced in &quot;Testing software design modeled by finite state machines&quot; by T.S. Chow.
        This method can be restricted with a maximum depth.
    </dd>
    <dt>Hypothesis</dt>
    <dd>
        Uses an ideal model of an application to search for separating words and uses them as counterexamples.
        Note that the input alphabets should be the same.
    </dd>
</dl>  

<p>In order to simplify the modeling phase, only the alphabet and the reset symbol has to be chosen. 
As default, the TTT algorithm is selected in combination with the random word oracle. 
A click on the button with the label &quot;start&quot; starts the learning process with the given configuration. 
The user gets redirected to a loading screen where the generated hypothesis is displayed as soon as the server generated one.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    The usage of the TTT algorithm is generally preferred from a users view as it outperforms the other algorithms in
    terms of speed. Furthermore, the default eq oracle configuration should be adjusted as it is chosen like it is for
    very small applications.
</div>

<p>While ALEX is learning there are some restrictions concerning the functionality. 
You can not delete the current project as the instance is required by the learner. 
Due to the architecture of ALEX, there can always only be one learning process at a time.</p>
<p>While the learning screen is shown, the number of already executed MQs and the time that has passed since the learn
process started are displayed.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
    If you encounter that the number of executed MQs has not changed in a long time, it might be, depending on the size
    of your alphabet, that the learner hung up. Please have a look at the terminal output. If it is not active, a
    forced restart of ALEX is necessary.
</div>


<h3 id="hypothesis-interaction">Hypothesis Interaction</h3>
<p>The possibility to interact with generated models can be separated into two phases. The first one is while a learn
process is running and the second one is after having finished learning an applications. The latter is dealt with in the
section <a href="#Learning_Experiment_Analysis" title="Learning Experiment Analysis">Learning Experiment Analysis <b class="caret"></b></a>.</p>
<p>Hypotheses are displayed as Mealy Machines and represent the learned behaviour of the tested application. Nodes are
labeled from 0 to n. The green node represents the initial state. Depending on the failed or successful execution of a
symbol, edges are labeled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;abbreviation&gt;/OK</li>
<li>&lt;abbreviation&gt;/FAILED(&lt;number&gt;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one indicates that the symbol with the displayed abbreviation could be executed successfully. The second one
shows that the execution of the symbol has failed. The number gives a hint on what action resulted in the failure. The
expression <em>FAILED(1)</em> for example tells that the first action of the symbol has failed to execute correctly.</p>
<h4 id="internal-data-structures">Internal Data Structures</h4>
<p>ALEX provides the visualisation of the <em>Observation Table</em> that is used by the <em>LStar</em> algorithm and the <em>Discrimination
Tree</em> from the equally named algorithm. Both are saved for each iteration the learner executes and can be displayed in
the same panel corresponding hypothesis is presented in. While observation tables can be exported as a CSV file,
discrimination trees can be downloaded in the SVG format.</p>
<h4 id="testing-counterexamples">Testing Counterexamples</h4>
<p>In between two iterations of a learn process it is possible to search and test counterexamples directly on the
displayed hypothesis and then start the next iteration with respect to entered counterexamples. This process follows
this patter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the equivalence oracle <em>Sample</em> from the widget in the sidebar</li>
<li>Create a word by clicking on the labels of the hypothesis</li>
<li>In the widget click on the button <em>&quot;Test&quot;</em></li>
<li>A notification will tell whether the word is a counterexample or not</li>
<li>Click on the button <em>&quot;Add&quot;</em> to add the counterexample the list that is considered for refinement</li>
<li>Proceed with step 1 or resume the learn process</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that while testing a word and it results in being a counterexample, its output labels are automatically switched
to the actual output sequence. The list of symbols can be arranged with drag and drop for quickly testing different
words. Once a counterexample has been added to the list, it can be edited by clicking on it.</p>
<p>The server assumes that all words given by a user for the refinement actually are counterexamples. If this is not the
case the learn process may fail and the application may have to be restarted by killing the running process.</p>
<h3 id="learning-experiment-analysis">Learning Experiment Analysis</h3>
<p>After having learned an application, their test results are available for an analysis. This can happen in two ways
that the next sections deals with.</p>
<h4 id="hypotheses-comparison">Hypotheses Comparison</h4>
<p>The first point is the visual comparison of hypotheses in a single tab. The page for that can be equally separated into
multiple columns, where each column can present a hypothesis or an internal data structure. That way it is possible to
have a look at the internal data structure and the hypothesis at the same time. Another possibility is to compare two
or more hypotheses of several test runs. The only restriction is that results can only be compared to other results from
the same project.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/hypotheses-comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison of hypotheses"></p>
<p>The image above presents an example of a comparison of the same test run.
By clicking on the grey area on the right of the display a new column is created.
By clicking on the red button in a panel, the column is removed and the size of the other columns.</p>
<h4 id="statistics">Statistics</h4>
<p>On the statistics page a list of learn results is presented.
It is either possible to generate a bar chart of a selection of final results or an area chart.
This one not only includes the cumulated values, but displays all values of all iterations of each step of multiple learn processes.
Statistics can be generated for the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of conducted membership queries</li>
<li>The number of conducted equivalence queries</li>
<li>The number of called symbols</li>
<li>The size of the input alphabet</li>
<li>The time it took to finish the test or a single step</li>
</ul>
<p>Each generated chart can be exported as a SVG file.
Furthermore, an export of these values in a CSV file for further research is possible, too.
The image below shows an example of a chart of multiple final results (left) and one from multiple complete results (right).
In the second case the visibility of single tests can be toggled by clicking on the legend entry with the corresponding test number.</p>
