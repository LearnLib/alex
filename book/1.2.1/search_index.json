Learning EXperience (ALEX) is a web application that allows you easily infer models of web applications and JSON-based REST services using active automata learning.\nHow it works\nLet us take a look at the example of an authentication system.\nFor an integration test you would probably write tests using Selenium or something else that check the following behavior:\n\nregister > login > logout should work\nlogout should not work\nregister > logout should not work\n...\n\nWith increasing complexity and feature set of an application, integration tests might be hard to maintain if all possible and impossible combinations of features should be tested.\nWith ALEX, we follow a different, more automated approach that\n\ndoes not require any knowledge about the implementation of an application,\ndoes not require any experience in programming and\nseparates the language specific tests from the application to test.\n\nAssume the authentication system mentioned above has the following features: register, login and logout.\nThen, we model each feature independent of each other using e.g. Selenium.\nIn Active Automata Learning, this set of testable features is called alphabet where the elements of the alphabet are called symbols.\nA sequence of symbols is called a word.\nWe then pass the learning alphabet to a learner that uses specific algorithms to create a model of the underlying application and how it behaves based on the given symbols.\nTherefore, words are executed on the real system under learning and its reactions are observed.\nFinally, the learner creates a hypothesis as an output that is modeled as a Mealy machine.\nIn this example, it would hopefully look like this:\n\nAs it can be seen, the learner has learned the application and all features work as intended.\nFrom here on, more symbols can be added and learned.\nIt can be that the learner has not learned the application correctly, i.e. there is a word in the model that has a different output than the actual application.\nIn fact, one can never be a 100% sure if the model actually represents the system under learning.\nHow to check for and handle these mistakes is described in the user manual.\nIf you want to know more about Active Automata Learning, you can find some resources at Google Scholar or the homepage of the LearnLib.\nInstallation and first login\nWe developed and tested ALEX using either Windows 8.1 and higher and Linux Ubuntu 14.10 and higher.\nAs the application runs on JAVA, any other system with an installed JVM should do fine.\nWe also advise to use a modern web browser like Google Chrome >= v46, Mozilla Firefox >= v42 or Microsoft Edge with JavaScript enabled in order to run the front-end properly.\nAfter the first start, you can login as admin backend using the account below.\n\n    Admin Account\n    Email: admin@alex.example \n    Password: admin\n\n\nUsing the packaged version\nMake sure you have Java 8 installed on your system.\n\nDownload the latest version. Download\nOpen a terminal and start the war archive using java -jar ALEX.war [--port=XXXX]\nOpen http://localhost:8000 in a web browser\n\nFrom source\nFor the Installation from the source files make sure your system matches the following system requirements:\n\nJava JDK 8\nMaven 3\nNode.js v6.9.* and the NPM\n\nTo install and run ALEX, execute the following commands in a directory of your choice:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/LearnLib/alex.git\ncd alex/main/src/main/webapp\nnpm install\ncd ../../../..\nmvn install [-DskipTests]\ncd main\nmvn spring-boot:run [-Dport=XXXX]\nopen http://localhost:8000 in a web browser\n\nFurther reading\n\nUser manual\nDeveloper docs\n\nFAQs\nIs ALEX ready for production use? \nALEX has already been used by a class at the TU Dortmund University as a tool to test a student project.\nAs far as we are concerned, we used the application to learn applications like Bugzilla and parts of the famous Wordpress.\nCould I potentially learn any available application that is accessible over the internet? \nYes, you could, but really should not do that, since testing usually takes a lot of traffic, and your test targets may not like it.\nBut we do not pragmatically prohibit it either.\nThe primary use case is to use ALEX for testing applications that are installed locally or in the same network.\nDo I really not have to have any programming experience? \nYes and no, it depends on how you define programming experience.\nWe made the best efforts to abstract all necessary steps to test a web application with ease.\nWhile modelling Selenium tests, it may eventually be helpful to have basic understanding of HTML and CSS.\nThe same goes for modelling REST tests where it is needed that you can write JSON documents.\nBut to our understanding neither JSON, HTML nor CSS are programming languages.\nHow potent does my system have to be to run tests? \nLearning is a CPU and memory intense process, but we cannot really tell you an lower bound for your system specs.\nFrom our own observations, it is advised to have at least 2Gb of RAM and a relatively modern Dual Core CPU to run tests at a satisfiable performance.\nThe more power your system has, the faster your tests should execute.\nBut feel free to test it on your Raspberry PI.\nI want to learn a specific feature of my application but ALEX does not provide a way to model it. What can I do? \nInitially, we did not develop ALEX as a solution to all situations that may occur in a web application, but to the most common ones.\nIf you think a key feature is missing, feel free to submit an issue and we will see what we can do.\n"},"contents/user-manual/":{"url":"contents/user-manual/","title":"User Manual","keywords":"","body":"User Manual\nHere we present a detailed explanation of the concepts and ways to use ALEX.\nIf you find bugs of any kind relating this application or inaccuracies in this manual,\nlet us know.\nDescription and Features\nALEX offers a simplicity-oriented way to model and execute learning experiments for web applications and web services\nusing active automata learning. Based on the function set of the LearnLib\nand inspired by the LearnLib Studio the\napplication lays a focus on the ease to use of the tool while offering an extensive feature set:\n\nInferring Mealy machines of web applications and web services using active automata learning techniques\nSupport for managing and learning multiple applications\nGraphical symbol construction\nGraphical learn process modelling\nAutomatic generation and visualization of\nHypotheses\nInternal data structures (Observation table and Discrimination tree)\nStatistics regarding learn results\n\n\nSimultaneous learning of web applications and web services\nAlgorithms: L*, TTT, Discrimination Tree, DHC, Kearns & Vazirani\nEquivalence oracles: Random Word, Complete, Sample, W-Method, Hypothesis\nImport and export of symbol sets and projects\nExport of hypotheses as JSON and SVG\nExport of internal data structures\nExport of statistics\nAnd more...\n\nWorking Objects\n\n    Project\n    A project is the main object that the following objects belong to. It is bound to a unique name and a URL that\n    starts with *\"http\\[s\\]://\"*. This property defines the root URL of the application under testing. In ALEX it is\n    allowed to create and manage multiple projects, thus, for example, allowing to treat a web application and a web\n    service as different projects or managing multiple complete different applications. A project can have multiple URLs\n    where *the same* application can be accessed to make use of parallelisation techniques.\n    Symbol Group\n    Each project has a list of symbol groups. Symbol groups are logical container for symbols. They allow to group \n    symbols, for example by their purpose or a feature. They are defined by a unique name. For every project, there is \n    a default group with the name \"Default Group\" which can not be deleted.\n    Symbol\n    Symbols are used by the learner to learn an application. They are defined by a unique name and an abbreviation.\n    The latter is shown as an edge label of the inferred model to make it visually clear. Each symbol\n    consists of an ordered list of actions that define the actual logic of the symbol once it is executed.\n    Action\n    Actions are atomic operations on an application. In ALEX, there are three types. Web actions are\n    inspired by Selenium and directly interact with the web interface of an application that is for example is clicking a\n    button, filling out input fields and submitting forms. REST actions allow to define actions with\n    a REST API and General actions allow interoperability between actions and symbols.\n    Learn Configuration\n    For each learn process, a learn configuration has to be created. It consists of an alphabet, which is a set\n    of created symbols, a reset symbol (a symbol that is used to reset an application before each MQ), a learn\n    algorithm, an equivalence oracle and some other parameters. Of cause the length the alphabet has to contain at \n    least one symbol and reset symbol is required as well.\n    Learn Result\n    As soon as a learn process has finished, a learn result is generated for each step the learner took to generate\n    the final hypothesis. For each step, it contains the actual learn configuration, statistics and the hypothesis as\n    a JSON representation.\n\n\n\nWorkflow\nWhen working with ALEX, the workflow for learning a web application starting with the creation of a project and resulting\nin the generation of a model of this application follows a common pattern. The next chapters deal with an in-depth view\non the points listed below:\n\nCreate a project with the root URL where the target application can be accessed\nOptionally create several symbol groups\nCreate a set of symbols, including one that handles the reset logic\nCreate actions for each symbol\nConfigure a learning process and start learning\nDisplay the hypothesis, internal data structures, analyze the statistics\n\nFrontend\nStarting from the entry URL of ALEX, the graphical client can be accessed under http:/localhost:\\/app. From there\non the following URLs lead to different parts of the application.\n\n\n\nURL\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n/about\nAn information page about the application\n\n\n/counters\nLists and manages the counters of a project\n\n\n/error\nShows fatal error messages\n\n\n/files\nLists and manages uploaded files to a project\n\n\n/help\nA page that lists information about ALEX\n\n\n/home\nThe home screen to login and create new users\n\n\n/learner/setup\nSetup and start a learning experiment\n\n\n/learner/start\nShows the loadscreen and intermediate learning results\n\n\n/projects\nShows a list of all projects of a user\n\n\n/projects/dashboard\nShows the dashboard of the opened project\n\n\n/symbols\nCreate, update & delete symbol groups and symbols\n\n\n/symbols//actions\nManage actions of a specific symbol\n\n\n/symbols//history\nRestore old revisions of a specific symbol\n\n\n/symbols/test\nBuild and test sequences of symbols\n\n\n/symbols/trash\nRestore deleted symbols\n\n\n/symbols/import\nImport symbols from a *.json file\n\n\n/results\nLists all finished final learning results of a project\n\n\n/results//compare\nShow the hypotheses of the processes with \n\n\n/settings\nSpecify web drivers\n\n\n/statistics\nShow a list of learner results and choose some for stats\n\n\n/statistics//compare\nShow statistics for learner results with \n\n\n\nExcept for the about, help, error and the home page, all other routes require that a user is logged in and a project has been created and is opened.\nUser Management\nThere are two roles in ALEX: ADMIN and USER where admins are allowed to update and delete normal users. \nAt the first start a default admin account is created which you can use instantly to login into the application:\nEmail:        admin@alex.example\nPassword: admin\nApplication Settings\nThere are some global application specific settings only admins can edit.\nWebdriver\nFor learning web applications, we use Selenium to interact with web browsers. \nPer default, only the headless HTMLUnitDriver is supported, but it does not work very well with websites that make heavy use of JavaScript.\nLuckily, there are third party drivers, that allow executing tests on Firefox, Chrome etc. \nIn order to use them, you have to download the corresponding executables and specify them in ALEX on the settings page as depicted in the following image (here for Windows):\n\nProject Management\nProjects are the entities that are used to manage multiple target applications in ALEX. You can for example create\na project for your application in version x and another one for version x+1 while having a different sets of input symbols.\nMost of the URLs listed in the previous section require a project to be opened, which means has been selected from the\napplications start page. It is then saved in the session storage of the web browser. In case a project is persisted no\nother project can be opened in the same tab. The use of multiple tabs allows to open and work with multiple projects at a\ntime. In order to switch to another project of the same tab, it has to be closed. That means it has to be removed from\nthe session storage, either by clicking the menu item from the main navigation or by closing the current tab.\nCreate, Edit and Delete Projects\n\n\n\nField\nDescription\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nName\nA unique name for your project\nyes\n\n\nURL\nThe root URL your application is accessible under\nyes\n\n\nDescription\nA description of your project\nno\n\n\nMirror URLs\nAlternative URLs where the target is accessible under\nno\n\n\n\nThe URL of a new project has to start with http:// or https:// followed by at least one further character for the\nhost. Technically, any host can be entered and therefore any web site can be learned. Due to the traffic that is caused\nby the learn process, it is recommended to only learn web applications you are the owner of, be it a local or a\nremote host.\nIf the creation has been successful a user should be redirected to the front page where the newly created project is\nnow listed. A click on it opens the project and leads to a work in progress dashboard which is the entry point for every\nother interaction with your project.\nIn order to switch to another project you have to close the current one at first. The button for this action can be\nfound in the menu under the navigation point with the name of the opened project. It redirects to the front-page. For\nworking on multiple projects simultaneously, you can open another tab and call ALEX from that one again.\nDeleting and updating projects can be done under the premise that there is no active learn process with the project,\nBefore deleting a project, make sure you have exported your symbols, hypotheses and/or statistics because with the\ndeleting of a project, all these values are deleted from the server, too.\nExport & Import\nIn the project overview, you will find an entry in the dropdown menu beside each project that allows you to export the\ncorresponding project. Import it in the same view by clicking on the import tab. Then, drag the json file in the visible\nfield and click on the button \\\"Import Project\\\". Change the name of the project in case there is already one with the\nsame name.\nProject export and import might be buggy.\n\n\nSymbol Management\nSymbol Groups\nWith symbol groups symbols of a project can be organized. For example you can create a group that contains symbols that\nare used to reset an application, another one for web related symbols and a further one for symbols relating to your\nREST API, but it's completely up to you. Do not mistake a symbol group for an alphabet! A symbol group is just a\ncontainer for symbols and should help you organize them.\nSymbol groups can be created, edited and deleted under the URL /symbols. In order to create a new one, hover over the\ncreate button in the sub-navigation and click on the corresponding entry. In the modal window choose a unique name\nfor a symbol group. In order to change the name of a group or to delete it, click on the gear-button beside the symbol\ngroup name and do these actions in the modal window.\nALEX offers a default group where new symbols are moved to if no other group is specified. It can not be deleted, but\nrenamed. Furthermore, deleting a symbol group induces all symbol to get deleted as well (more in the next chapter).\nFor a better overview over a large set of symbols, symbol groups can be collapsed by clicking on the arrow button on\nthe left of each entry.\nSymbols\nSymbols can be created, updated, deleted and moved into into other symbol groups. The creation of a symbol requires\nseveral properties.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nA unique name of the symbol\n\n\nabbreviation\nA unique abbreviation with 15 characters at max. They are displayed in the hypotheses and should be named meaningfully\n\n\nsymbol group\nOptionally the symbol group the symbol should be created in can be passed. If this property is not given, the symbol is moved to the default group\n\n\n\nNote that once you delete a symbol it is not permanently removed from the server, but hidden. As a consequence, they\ncan be made visible by going to /symbols/trash or by clicking the corresponding menu entry in the sidebar. There, a\nlist of all hidden symbols is given. Recovering a symbol makes it appear again in the group it previously was in. In\ncase the group has been deleted, the symbol is moved to the default group.\nActions\nThe functionality of a symbol is defined by its actions and their execution order. An action can be understood as a real\ninteraction with a system, like clicking on buttons, submitting forms, making requests to an API and so on.\nIn order to manage actions of a single symbol, go to /symbols/\\/actions or click on the link below a symbol\nunder /symbols. Here, actions can be created, edited, deleted and ordered. The list that is shown represents the order\nof execution on the application as soon as the symbol is called by the learner. Make sure to save changes that have been\nmade in the current session, since CRUD operations and re-ordering of actions is not saved automatically. This is simply\npossible by clicking the save button on the right in the sub-menu.\nThe creation of actions is realized in a modal window that shows the action editor as shown in the picture above. As one\ncan see, the left column contains dropdown boxes with a logical grouping of actions. The right column reveals a form\nwith required input fields for a selected action. The action groups are presented in to following.\nEach action can be marked with three different flags which are\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnegated\nNegates the outcome of an action.\n\n\nignoreFailure\nIf this flag is set to \"true\" proceedings actions are executed although the action failed\n\n\ndisabled\nIf this flag is set to \"true\" its execution is skipped during the call of its symbol\n\n\n\nWeb Actions\nWeb actions are used to interact with a browser interface as a real person would do. They are based on Selenium actions\nand ALEX offers a subset of these that are presented in the table below.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCheck Attribute\nChecks the value of an attribute of an element\n\n\nCheck Node\nCheck if a certain element is present on the website.\n\n\nCheck Text\nCheck if a certain text is part of the website body.\n\n\nCheck Title\nChecks if the page title is a certain string.\n\n\nClear\nClear an input field.\n\n\nClick\nClick or double click on an element.\n\n\nClick Link By Text\nClick on a link with a specific text value.\n\n\nExecute JavaScript\nExecute a JavaScript snipped in the page.\n\n\nFill\nClear and fill an input field with some text.\n\n\nOpen URL\nRequest a specific site.\n\n\nMove Mouse\nMove the cursor to a specific element or coordinates\n\n\nPress Key\nPress a special key on the keyboard\n\n\nSubmit\nSubmit a form.\n\n\nSelect\nSelect an option form an select input field.\n\n\nWait for Title\nWait until the title of a page changes.\n\n\nWait for Node\nWait until the state of an element changes.\n\n\n\nMore detailed information about all the parameters of each web action is omitted as this point, since the forms in the\nfront-end should be labeled sufficiently.\nIf you play around a little with the action editor, you may realize that most web actions require you to enter a CSS or\nand XPath selector to an affected element. This may be not that easy to find out in case you are not very familiar with \nHTML. So, there is a button that is labeled with \"Element Picker\". This is a special feature of ALEX for selecting \nHTML elements from your website directly without having to know HTML. Note that this only extracts CSS selectors.\nHTML Element Picker\nThe HTML element picker has been tested but it can not be ensured that picking the right element works in all possible\nuse cases. If the HTML picker should fail you can still get the CSS path of an element with the developer tools of your\nbrowser.\nIn Google Chrome, make a right click on the desired element and choose the entry Inspect Element. The developer tools\nsidebar should open and reveal the element in the DOM tree. There, make another right click on the element and choose\nCopy CSS Path which copies the unique CSS selector in the clipboard of your operating system. A similar approach can\nbe applied with Firefox.\n\nLoad a URL by entering a path relative to the base URL of the project in the URL bar on the top left.\nClick on the button with the wand symbol. All elements should now get a thick red border as soon as you hover over it.\nClick on the element you need the CSS path from. The selection mode should be disabled.\nClick on the button with the label \"ok\" on the top right. The CSS path should automatically be entered in the correct\ninput element.\n\nIn the case that clicking on an element does not work as indented, probably because of some JavaScript, pressing the\n\"Ctrl\" button on the keyboard has the same effect as a click, but does not fire a click event.\nFor some actions, like \"CheckText\", the HTML element picker can be used as well. With the same method, it automatically\nextracts the textContent value of an element and pastes the content to the corresponding input field. This also works\nwith the \"Fill\" action. Enter a value in the desired input field, select the element with the HTML element picker and it\nextracts both, the value and the CSS path of it.\nREST Actions\nREST actions are the counterpart to web actions. They are used to communicate with RESTful interfaces. The table below\nshows a list of available actions.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCall\nDo a REST Call.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Exists\nCheck if the response has an specific attribute.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Type\nCheck if an attribute in the response has a specific type.\n\n\nCheck Attribute Value\nCheck if an attribute in the response has a specific value.\n\n\nCheck Header Field\nCheck if the response has a certain header field.\n\n\nCheck Status\nCheck if a previous response returned the expected HTTP status.\n\n\nCheck Text\nCheck the response body.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that working with HTTP requests and responses follows a certain pattern. Normally, you make a request and\nanalyze the results. The order of your REST actions should also look like that. Start with a Call action and use other\nactions to work with the response.\nGeneral Actions\nActions of this group allow the interaction between different symbols and actions, for example by storing and passing\nString and Integer values to other actions.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAssert Counter\nAsserts the value of a counter.\n\n\nAssert Variable\nAsserts the value of a variable.\n\n\nIncrement Counter\nIncrement a counter by a given value.\n\n\nExecute Symbol\nInclude and execute another symbol.\n\n\nSet Counter\nSet a counter to a new value.\n\n\nSet Variable\nSet a variable to a new value.\n\n\nSet Variable by Cookie\nSet a variable to the value of a cookie\n\n\nSet Variable by HTML Element\nSet a variable to a value form a website element.\n\n\nSet Variable by JSON Attribute\nSet a variable to a value form a JSON response.\n\n\nSet Variable by Node Attribute\nSet a variable to the value of an attribute of an element.\n\n\nSet Variable by Node Count\nSet a variable to the number of elements matching a selector.\n\n\nSet Variable by Regex Group\nSet a variable to a group in a regex match.\n\n\nWait\nWait for a specific amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n    The wait action can be useful for background tasks or AJAX calls, but should be used with caution because it can slow\n    down the learn process.\n\n\n\nWorking with Counters, Variables and Files\nMany web applications handle dynamic data and allow file uploads. In order to model and learn such behaviors and to\nallow interaction between different symbols, actions and learn processes, counters, variables and files are\nintroduced.\n\n    Counter\n    \n        As the name indicates counters are integer values that are persisted in the database per project. They\n        can be incremented and set at will. Commonly they are used to create multiple objects of the same kind. Counters\n        can help to model a system reset and thereby allow a consecutive execution of multiple learn processes without\n        having to manually reset the application in between every test.\n    \n    Variables\n    \n        Variables can only contain String values and are kept alive for a single membership query.\n    \n    Files\n    \n        In order to learn websites that allow its users to upload files, this feature can be used as well. Make sure the\n        file that should be uploaded for learn purposes has been imported to the project of the website.\n    \n\n\nIn order to make use of those in actions, there is a notation that has to be used in action fields, as presented in the\nfollowing table.\n\n\n\nNotation\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of the counter with the name counterName is inserted\n\n\n\nThe value of the variable with the name variableName is inserted\n\n\n\nThe absolute path of the file filename.ext is inserted\n\n\n\nAs an example for the use of counters and variables, let there be a variable userName with the value \\'Admin\\' and\na counter countLogins with the value \\'5\\'. The following symbol makes use of both.\n[{\n    \"name\" : \"symbol1\",\n    \"abbreviation\" : \"s1\",\n    \"actions\" : [{\n        \"type\" : \"web_checkForText\",\n        \"value\" : \"Hello ! You logged in for the th time.\",\n        \"regexp\" : false\n    }]\n}, ... ]\n\nAs soon as the action is executed the value of the property \\'value\\' is parsed, the values for the variable userName\nand the counter countLogins are inserted into the String. The resulting text that is searched for would be \\\"Hello\nAdmin! You logged in for the 5th time today.\\\".\nNormally, files are only applied to input fields with the type \\\"file\\\", but do as you please. Given the following\nelement on a page\n\n\nThe action would look like this:\n[{\n    ...\n    \"actions\" : [{\n        \"type\" : \"web_fill\",\n        \"node\" : {\n            \"selector\" : \"#fileInput\",\n            \"type\" : \"CSS\" \n        },\n        \"value\" : \"\"\n    }]\n}, ... ]\n\n\n    Be aware that currently, due to the limitations of the used Selenium webdriver, the upload of files only works if\n    a learn process is executed with enabled javascript, which is enabled by default.\n\n\n\nExport & Import\nIf you want to save a set of symbols for another project or use already existing ones, the export and import function\nmight be of interest for you. Note that when exporting symbols, their id and group are deleted in order to be\ncompatible with other projects.\nALEX supports the import from and export in a JSON file. Technically, the possibility of creating symbols with a simple\ntext editor by hand and uploading them to the system is given. Therefore, the file has to look as follows:\n[{\n    \"name\" : \"symbol1\",\n    \"abbreviation\" : \"s1\",\n    \"actions\" : [ ... ]\n}, ... ]\n\nLearning Experiment Modelling\nIn order to start learning an application, a learn process has to be modeled. Such a process always consists of the\nfollowing components:\n\nAn input alphabet (set of symbols)\nA symbol to reset the application\nAn algorithm\nA parametrized equivalence oracle\nA maximum amount of steps to learn\nA specification of a web browser\n\n\n    Algorithm\n    \n        There are currently five algorithms supported: L*, Discrimination Tree, DHC, Kearns & Vazirani and TTT.\n    \n    Equivalence oracle\n    \n        ALEX supports five kinds of oracles. Those are: Random Word, Complete, W-Method, Sample and Hypothesis. \n        The first three oracles approximate equivalence queries automatically to find counterexamples while when using\n        Sample, you are asked to search and enter them by yourself in between iterations. \n        If the Hypothesis EQ oracle is used, the shortest separating word between the learned and the given model is used as counterexample.\n        This however presumes that the alphabets of both models are equal.\n    \n    Steps to learn\n    \n        You can also define how many hypotheses should be generated at maximum. When the learner stops, you can still continue\n        learning from this point.\n    \n    Comment\n    \n        Furthermore a comment can be added that makes it easier to identify a specific learn result between others. The\n        comment is a string value with a maximum amount of 120 characters.\n    \n    Web driver\n    \n        Choose a web browser where the tests should be run in. \n        Per default, the headless HTML Unit Driver is selected. \n        For all others, make sure you have it installed, otherwise the application might crash.\n        Also, define the size of the browser window. \n        If the height and width are set to 0px, the web drivers predefined dimensions are used.\n    \n    Membership query cache\n    \n        If membership queries should be cached. Enabling this option often reduces the total learning time.\n    \n\n\nThe mentioned equivalence oracles have different strategies on how to find counterexamples. \nEach one can be configured with different parameters that define their behaviour.\n\n    Random Word\n    \n        The Random Word oracle approximates equivalence queries by generating random words from learned symbol set and\n        executes them on the learned applications. The oracles expects three parameters: minLength defines the\n        minimum length of a generated word, maxLength the maximum length and numberOfWords the amount\n        of randomly generated words to test.\n    \n    Complete\n    \n        This oracle generates all possible word within some limits. minDepth describes the minimum length of\n        a generated word, maxDepth the maximum length.\n    \n    Sample\n    \n        If this oracle is chosen, counterexamples are searched by hand by the user.\n    \n    W-Method\n    \n        Uses the W-Method introduced in \"Testing software design modeled by finite state machines\" by T.S. Chow.\n        This method can be restricted with a maximum depth.\n    \n    Hypothesis\n    \n        Uses an ideal model of an application to search for separating words and uses them as counterexamples.\n        Note that the input alphabets should be the same.\n    \n  \n\nIn order to simplify the modeling phase, only the alphabet and the reset symbol has to be chosen. \nAs default, the TTT algorithm is selected in combination with the random word oracle. \nA click on the button with the label \"start\" starts the learning process with the given configuration. \nThe user gets redirected to a loading screen where the generated hypothesis is displayed as soon as the server generated one.\n\n    The usage of the TTT algorithm is generally preferred from a users view as it outperforms the other algorithms in\n    terms of speed. Furthermore, the default eq oracle configuration should be adjusted as it is chosen like it is for\n    very small applications.\n\n\nWhile ALEX is learning there are some restrictions concerning the functionality. \nYou can not delete the current project as the instance is required by the learner. \nDue to the architecture of ALEX, there can always only be one learning process at a time.\nWhile the learning screen is shown, the number of already executed MQs and the time that has passed since the learn\nprocess started are displayed.\n\n    If you encounter that the number of executed MQs has not changed in a long time, it might be, depending on the size\n    of your alphabet, that the learner hung up. Please have a look at the terminal output. If it is not active, a\n    forced restart of ALEX is necessary.\n\n\n\nHypothesis Interaction\nThe possibility to interact with generated models can be separated into two phases. The first one is while a learn\nprocess is running and the second one is after having finished learning an applications. The latter is dealt with in the\nsection Learning Experiment Analysis .\nHypotheses are displayed as Mealy Machines and represent the learned behaviour of the tested application. Nodes are\nlabeled from 0 to n. The green node represents the initial state. Depending on the failed or successful execution of a\nsymbol, edges are labeled as follows:\n\n/OK\n/FAILED()\n\nThe first one indicates that the symbol with the displayed abbreviation could be executed successfully. The second one\nshows that the execution of the symbol has failed. The number gives a hint on what action resulted in the failure. The\nexpression FAILED(1) for example tells that the first action of the symbol has failed to execute correctly.\nInternal Data Structures\nALEX provides the visualisation of the Observation Table that is used by the LStar algorithm and the Discrimination\nTree from the equally named algorithm. Both are saved for each iteration the learner executes and can be displayed in\nthe same panel corresponding hypothesis is presented in. While observation tables can be exported as a CSV file,\ndiscrimination trees can be downloaded in the SVG format.\nTesting Counterexamples\nIn between two iterations of a learn process it is possible to search and test counterexamples directly on the\ndisplayed hypothesis and then start the next iteration with respect to entered counterexamples. This process follows\nthis patter:\n\nChoose the equivalence oracle Sample from the widget in the sidebar\nCreate a word by clicking on the labels of the hypothesis\nIn the widget click on the button \"Test\"\nA notification will tell whether the word is a counterexample or not\nClick on the button \"Add\" to add the counterexample the list that is considered for refinement\nProceed with step 1 or resume the learn process\n\nNote that while testing a word and it results in being a counterexample, its output labels are automatically switched\nto the actual output sequence. The list of symbols can be arranged with drag and drop for quickly testing different\nwords. Once a counterexample has been added to the list, it can be edited by clicking on it.\nThe server assumes that all words given by a user for the refinement actually are counterexamples. If this is not the\ncase the learn process may fail and the application may have to be restarted by killing the running process.\nLearning Experiment Analysis\nAfter having learned an application, their test results are available for an analysis. This can happen in two ways\nthat the next sections deals with.\nHypotheses Comparison\nThe first point is the visual comparison of hypotheses in a single tab.

These rely on our own experiences while modelling and learning several web applications and REST interfaces.\nSymbol modelling\nWhen modelling symbols, the granularity of modelling your application matters and it is advised that you think in use cases. Here is the reason why:\nFor example, if you create a new symbol for each possible click on each link or button, you might have a very detailed and concrete model of your application, but it will not be visually observable. Additionally, learning will usually take much longer as the number of symbols grows.\nOn the contrary, you should not treat a symbol as a whole integration test. For example you could create a symbol TestAuthenticationSystem that creates a user, logs him in and then out. This has several disadvantages. You do not test at any other point of your application if a logout is possible without explicitly modelling it twice. Furthermore, the learned model will most likely not represent your real system very accurately.  \nInstead, we think it is good if you create something in between those extremes. As already mentioned, try modelling use cases of your application. As an example, have a look at Wordpress. Possible symbols could be:\n\nLogin\nLogout\nCreate a post\nPublish a post\nMark a comment as spam\n...\n\nEach point can be modelled as a symbol and the learned model will tell you clearly what is possible and what is not while still be able to easily find possible errors in an application.\nModelling authentication systems\nBasic HTTP Authentication\nThe Call action and the Open URL action both support the specification of credentials, consisting of a login and a password, in order to use basic HTTP auth.\nJSON Web Tokens\nJWTs are usually used to authenticate against REST APIs by sending an encoded token in the Authorization header like Authorization: Bearer TOKEN. \nIn ALEX, you can specify HTTP headers in the Call action.\nResetting an application\nWhile learning, sequences of symbols are created and executed on your application. We assume that your application behaves deterministically, i.e. for each sequence that is executed it has to be made sure that the very same sequence will always, at any time in the system yield the same result. As a consequence, for each sequence, the system has to be put in a state where all further executions are independent from the ones before. For this reason it is required that you model a system reset with a separate symbol.\nWhat a reset looks like is up to you and depends on your application, but here are some examples that might be relevant for your application:\nIf you have a static web site that only consists of a few linked html files and you want to make sure they are linked correctly, the reset symbol could consist of an action to go to the front page.\nIf you have a user management system (like in the Wordpress example from above) and want to test user specific features only, your reset symbol could simply consist of the creation of a new user if the users actions are independant from each other. If we stick with the Wordpress example, this could be an example: You want to test a users ability to create, update and delete a post he created. Then, a reset could create a new user and log him in. If he now creates a new post, his action does not interfere with actions executed by previous users.\nThen, sometimes, you want to test exactly how the actions of one user impact the actions of another one or how they work together. The tasks of creating and publishing a post could be executed by users of different roles. For this case, we came up with the ability to store variables and counters that should help you with modelling these kinds of situations.\nSometimes it may be necessary to reset a complete database in order to remove all working objects. Since we have no actions that connect to your database to execute queries (would be a cool feature though...) you will have to work around that, e.g. by creating a temporary REST API endpoint that is called for that or by pressing some button that is hidden in the admin panel, etc.\nAs you can see, how you model a system reset is not always a trivial problem and is highly dependant on how your application works and what exactly you want to test, so we can not give you a recipe for all possible use cases.\nLearn process configuration\nBefore you start a learn process, you can configure some parameters like the algorithm used or the equivalence oracle. ALEX runs all tests with reasonable preconfigured settings.\n\nIf the duration of the test is crucial to you, do not use any other algorithm than the TTT, it is the fastest algorithm out there right now.\nThe default settings for the Random Word oracle is ok for models that you expect not to get bigger than 4 to 6 states. There is no real rule of thumb here, but if you expect hypotheses bigger that that, adjust the parameters correspondingly.\nThe complete oracle can be used when you can run your tests over night or the weekend, or for a really small alphabet size. Same as with the W-Method oracle, since it works similarly.\nEnabling the membership query cache is preferred.\n\nLearning JavaScript enabled applications\n\nFor the execution of the experiments, don't choose a headless web browser like the HTML Unit Driver. Instead, configure ALEX to use either Chrome or Firefox.\nWhen modelling symbols for JavaScript heavy websites, e.g. single page applications, make use of the wait for node action when interacting with elements of the website. This way, Selenium can handle dynamic changes of the DOM better.\n\nFurther tips\n\nTry to avoid cyclic symbol calls, e.g. do not create a symbol A that calls symbol B that calls symbol A. The algorithm does not prevent cyclic symbol calls and will run forever.\nSometimes, you might get an error message while learning that says something like: expected symbol ok ok failed(1) but got symbol ok failed(2) ok. This error can, in most cases, be reduced to a non deterministic system or a faulty modelling, triggered by a counter that has not been incremented or something like that.\nIf possible, make use of the possibility to define multiple URLs where the target application can be accessed under. This way, membership queries can be executed in parallel which saves a lot of time, especially equivalence queries. \n\n"},"contents/developer-documents/":{"url":"contents/developer-documents/","title":"Developer Documents","keywords":"","body":"Developer docs\nSome documents that are useful for developers.\nSetup ALEX for development\nMake sure your machine has the following software installed:\n\nJava JDK 8 or greater\nNode.js v6.9.* or higher\nGit\nMaven 3.3.*\n\nClone the repository and install the frontend dependencies.\ngit clone https://github.com/LearnLib/alex.git\ncd alex/main/src/main/webapp\nnpm install\n\nGo back to the root folder and execute the following to install all java related dependencies:\nmvn install [-DskipTests]\n\nYou are done!

Implement the methods. \nAdd a new action\nExtend SymbolAction and implement the method execute(ConnectorManager connector) and add the new JSON sub type to the SymbolAction class like in the following:\n   // MyNewAction.java\n   @Entity\n   @DiscriminatorValue(\"new_action_name\")\n   @JsonTypeName(\"new_action_name\")\n   public class MyNewAction extends SymbolAction {\n       @Override\n       public ExecuteResult execute(ConnectorManager connector) {\n           // ...\n       }\n   }\n\n   // SymbolAction.java\n   // ...\n   @JsonSubTypes({\n        // ...\n        @JsonSubTypes.Type(name = \"new_action_name\", value = MyNewAction.class),\n   })\n   public abstract class SymbolAction implements Serializable {\n        // ...\n   }\n\nUse return getSuccessOutput(); or return getFailedOutput(); instead of directly return OK; or return FAILED;.\nSo the new action supports the negated attribute.\nAlso use insertVariableValues(String text) when possible to allow the use of variable and counters in the properties.\n"}}}
