# Pages

Here the paths of the application and their functionality are listed. The pages are chosen this way because they bundle frontend functionality concerning the abgular controller files. Furthermore, the amout of JavaScript files to be included in each page is nearly equally balanced so that there will be no performance issues.

Indented paths are subpaths, which are not directly served by the backend but invoked by angular. Parent paths are actually served by the Backend by a GET Request.
