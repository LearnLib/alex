# Integrations

ALEX offers some ways for integration in third party applications.

## Webhooks

[Webhooks][webhooks] are a way to let third party applications know about events that happen in your system.
These application have to register a webhook by specifying a URL.
When an event occurs, e.g. a learning process finished, ALEX sends a HTTP request to the registered URL.
If a body is send along the HTTP request, it is formatted as JSON object.

*Currently, if the target server cannot be reached within 3 seconds, the request is cancelled.
 We also do not provide any retry mechanism at the moment.*
